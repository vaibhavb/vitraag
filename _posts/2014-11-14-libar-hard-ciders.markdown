The [order](http://www.soundhomebrew.com/) is in - I'm getting some apple juice to try and make my first batch of Libar Hard Cider(s)! I'm trying two varieties of yeast with the first batch. Once the carboys are loaded tomorrow it will a couple of weeks for the yeast go to town and then we will (hopefully) celebrate the first case of ciders! Looking forward to plan that Libar Cider party.. :)<!-- more -->

Friends, Sound Home Brew and http://www.howtomakehardcider.com/ have imparted me immense support and knowledge. Hopefully the cider goddess will smile!
