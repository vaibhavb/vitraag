This year I'm doing a video report of our [Seattle to Portland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_to_Portland) 2-day, 200+ mile bike ride. Be gentle with my experimentation in movie making and spelling skills, and if you have not donated already please consider [supporting ](http://vitraag.blogspot.com/2008/07/sponsor-my-ride-help-cause.html)this ride, by making your contributions [here](http://www.ashanet.org/seattle/events/woc/profile_head.php?vaibhavb).  
  
  
  
I have shared the pictures of ride [here](http://flickr.com/photos/vaibhavb/tags/wheelsofchange2008/).
