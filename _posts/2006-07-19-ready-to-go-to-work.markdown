Today is the national ride your bike to work day! We had one at Microsoft too! I was there with my Mathilda. Check out the pics at my [flickr page](http://www.flickr.com/photos/vaibhavb/tags/ridetowork2006/). There were folks frequenting at 2fast, WMRRA and other track organizations! You can see it from there scrapped out left-side of tires - all tracks with left turns, well apparently tracks in Portland have right turns:). Any ways some one actually when to this [http://www.ononewheel.com](http://www.ononewheel.com) to do flip baby!! Looking forward to more riding this season, oh hoo.. now that my cycyling and mountaineering are almost gettin over! Party time...
