Another installment of pic and a poem inspired by [Daydreaming](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RLTaH2EOmI) in Blue Lines by Massive Attack

 

 

“Day dreaming, Soñar despierto

 

Wish i was a lizard, and i could crawl

 

Wish i was superman, and i could fly

 

My intentions are frolicky and I'm not a malvado

 

Tiennes solo una viva,lets strive for pura ¡viva!

 

If you dig your life add another line...”
