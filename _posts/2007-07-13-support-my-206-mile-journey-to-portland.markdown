I’m really thrilled to see our [team ](http://www.ashanet.org/seattle/events/woc/)grow from 5 folks 2 years before to 15 this year!! This year being my third year in the Saddle I would love if you join me in the ride to make a small difference. The first year was grueling and I was sore for few days, the second I stuck in and finished the ride, this year I’m trying to enjoy it and have Maris attempt it!! Hopefully I will be able to keep up with the Marathoner!

Donate per mile or donate in kind! [Support my ride](http://www.ashanet.org/seattle/events/woc/profile_head.php?vaibhav)!!!
