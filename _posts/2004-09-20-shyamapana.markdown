Its Shyampana Day - the last day of Parushan. Here is what i would like to say to all my buddies..  
  
Dear Friends:  
_Liebe Freunde  
_  
Of late I've really been guilty of not keeping in touch. So here is the reason - what better, a festival!! Yep it’s the "Shyamapana festival". Shyamapana is a festival of forgiveness; it’s popular in folks of [Jain faith](http://www.cs.colostate.edu/%7Emalaiya/jainhlinks.html). This day culminates a week long fest of repentance called as "Paryushan". To quote an [article](http://www.jainspirit.com/js1/viewindex.asp?currency=&article_id=Paryushan-festivalofSelf-Renewal&customer_id=par1275982XYGATPCK970) :  
  
"For 357 days of the year we carry out our responsibilities to our business, our family and our career. We live a very busy, worldly life. In the process, we accumulate a lot of mental and emotional clutter. We gather unnecessary baggage of pride, fear, animosity, greed, ego and delusions in our thoughts and feelings. So Paryushan is the time to clear that clutter and make a bonfire to burn that junk, that rubbish which is corrupting our minds, our lives and our relationships. The Jains have designed the special eight days of Paryushan as a time of reflection, purification and renewal."  
  
So over the last year if I would have hurt your feelings in any way or form, please forgive me – “Michammi Dukdam”  (“_Verzeihen Sie mir bitte_”) and give me mandate to start a new score J!!  
  
Take Care…  
  
Cheers,  
Vaibhav
