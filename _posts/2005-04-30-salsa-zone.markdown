I'm learning Salsa from [Michelle Badion](http://www.dancenewsletter.com/seattle/main.htm?salsa_danceschools.htm%7Emiddle) at the UW Experimental classes. I'm pretty interested by the moves I learned so far. Here is the sampler, well not a video tape yet but just more ramblings :).  
  


  * Dont do basic steps at any point the easiest thing to make the follower feel that she is going places is to keep doing half turns all the time.  

  * If you are in a close hand position and want to go to open arm position then do a half turn to get in that position.  

  * Basic step 1-3, turn - turn - turn 5-7, Back Step 1, She 2 goes, Back Step 3, he goes 5, back step 6, she goes 7, basic 1-3 : Is michelle favorite turn!  

  * Fancy turn: raise her arm- 1, back turn 2-3, turn her around to side 5-7 and she is locked in to you, front step 1,-3, turn her out 5-7 ...  

  * Side step has three turns: Full swing (one and half turn) outside turn, Half inside turn, full inside turn.  

  * Side step is like basic 1-3 and step on side on 5 and 6-7 is the turn or she goes to the other side (ie half turn).  

  
  
Thats all for Salsa as of now. I have to write the step in more detail and there are quite a few i forgot ;).
