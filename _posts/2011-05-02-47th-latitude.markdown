Another installment of pic and a poem inspired by [Kuzu kuzu](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ew2o0DnXpCI) by Tarkan

<pre>
“The weather swallows
It’s a herd of those clouds that follow
It is the drop of rain that precedes another
The skyline might change
But 47th latitude remains the same
It’s the weather that follows
Kuzu kuzu, its Karma, its constant”
</pre>
