On Aug 21-22, I’ll attempt to climb Mt. Rainier with [Team Asha](http://www.ashanet.org/seattle/events/climbforasha/climbers.php). Through the season the Team has really prepared hard to make this a successful and enjoyable climb! All the familiar faces and a very familiar cause! Please support the climbers and the cause!

**_The Cause?_**

I have climbed Rainier in [2006](http://ramblings.vitraag.com/2006/08/mt-rainier-a-blissful-climb/), [2009](http://ramblings.vitraag.com/2009/07/mt-rainier-climb-%E2%80%93-trip-report/) with a different causes – ranging from personal to helping [Mayaboli school](http://ramblings.vitraag.com/2005/12/mayaboli-school-for-hearing-impaired/).  I’m continuing the same causes this time but also helping a tiny bit in making other climbers succeed in their personal and benevolent goals!

I’m looking forward to amazing weather, a great team and fun times! I get to use [my climber’s pass](http://ramblings.vitraag.com/2010/07/mt-rainier-kautz-tricky-dc-red-tape-time-spent-awesome/) again this season!
