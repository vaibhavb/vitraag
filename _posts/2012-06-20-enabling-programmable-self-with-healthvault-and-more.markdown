Dear Reader – 

 

Apologies I have been a bit on blogging hiatus! Among other things, I recently released my book on HealthVault, [Enabling Programmable Self with HealthVault](http://www.amazon.com/Enabling-Programmable-Self-HealthVault-Accessible/dp/1449316565).

 

Quantified Self blog covered the book and the story behind it in its [toolmaker talk](http://quantifiedself.com/2012/04/toolmaker-talk-vaibhav-bhandari-enabling-programmable-self-with-healthvault/) series. Over next few weeks I’m hoping to post about a number of topics including Restful Health Exchange, NwHIN Governance, FHIR, HealthVault mobile applications and I’ll also be updating the compendium website for the book – [www.enablingprogrammableself.com](http://www.enablingprogrammableself.com). 

 

Please let me know in comments if you have suggestions for me to write about.

P.S. - I also moved on from Microsoft and I’m active in healthcare and technology community travelling frequently between Seattle, Bay Area and sometimes Minnesota.
