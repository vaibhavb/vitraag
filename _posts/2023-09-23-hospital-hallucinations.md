I feel like I should write a short story about all the hallucinations I had during my weekend stay at the hospital. üè•

So, let me close my eyes and recount this tale. This weekend, I found myself in the hospital‚Äîa daunting experience for a first-timer‚Äîbut I'm on the road to recovery and back home, facing life and its challenges head-on.

"What topic shall we delve into today?" This thought raced through my mind as I lay in my hospital bed, writhing in abdominal pain. I couldn't sleep; the discomfort kept me tossing and turning. One area of pain led to another, preventing me from even taking a brief nap. In this sleep-deprived state, my mind conjured up hallucinations. I saw a jumble of random events, pictures, scenes, and anecdotes.

I saw faces of loved ones mingling with strangers and acquaintances, all part of an ever-shifting tableau that my mind conjured within these "hallucination portals."

In one vivid image, I saw myself as a malevolent, Satanic figure‚Äîspewing curses and engrossed in disturbing acts. In another, I appeared calm, reading and meditating. The scenes shifted rapidly, and I was soon contemplating existential questions. I saw myself surrounded by historical thinkers‚ÄîPlato, Socrates, and others, pondering the meaning of life, death, and everything in between.

One idea resonated with me: the notion that we come into this world alone and will leave it in the same way. This thought anchored me during these rapid-fire visions.

Another portal showed snippets from various thinkers: "Cogito, ergo sum" ("I think, therefore I am"), "Miles to go before I sleep," and others, in languages spanning from Hindi to Urdu to Marathi.

Yet another image was a whirlwind of memories, loved ones, voices‚Äîmuch like a fidget spinner of my life's experiences and interactions. It was astonishing to see my life flash before my eyes in such a kaleidoscopic manner.

And then there was a portal filled with questions‚Äîquestions about who I am, where I'm going, and even existential and theological dilemmas.

Finally, I saw a screen filled with scrolling numbers, prompting me to ponder the relationship between humanity and numbers. Are numbers destined to replace us, or did we create them as mere tools?

In conclusion, whether numbers are good or bad, they're integral to our existence, shaping everything from blockchain technology to our very perceptions of the world.

Thus ended my weekend of hospital-induced visions, leaving me to wonder: Do we need numbers, or do numbers need us?
