Recently I have been intrigued by having some higher order principles for composing art. Similar to my explorations in computer generated music using Lisp. As part of a graduate course I tried to implement a program which generated rendition of a [raga](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raga) using the principles on which a raga is based i.e it has a vadi (dominant note), it has a samvadi (second dominant note), a set of notes, a well defined pakaad (signature notes), an aroha (ascending scale) and avaroh (descending scale); and finally a bhav (mood) and rasa (emotion).

I’m trying to understand visual art, and two principle which have understood of late are -

<!-- more -->1. **Use of golden ratio** – The clouds in the following iCloud logo are actually scaled in golden ratio!

2. **60:30:10 rule of composition** – I have been using this rule to fill the palette of interiors of my new place. Essential pick 60% color as the dominant color, 30% as the secondary color and 10% as the accent color.

Any other suggestions, dear reader?
