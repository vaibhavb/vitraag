# Generative Fill with Photoshop

I'm starting to compile things i create on a more regular basis. Lots of people do things they learn, I though why not have a list of things i create!

So fresh off the photoshop beta version is this generative fill i created with the Adobe Photoshop. Its super easy to [extend the canvas](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/generative-fill.html#apply-genai-fill) and then add an object trex in scene and then add a man playing music!
