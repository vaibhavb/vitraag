After the epic ride to Kovalam, we took wanted to take the next day a bit slow. But we started early but the route to Varkala was long turned out to be good 80km with a varied terrain.

We got to Varkala at about 4pm and then synced with my friends and decided to stay in the same abode. We hit the beach and enjoyed awesome long dinner at Gamma.

After a bit discussion we decided to take the next day as a day off given it was Christmas eve and Varkala had great beach, good friends and hey we needed some well-deserved rest!
