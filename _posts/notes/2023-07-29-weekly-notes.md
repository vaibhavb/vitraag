# From Code to Kitchen: A Week in Reads
This week, I've delved into a diverse mix of resources that have really got me thinking, ranging from foundational texts in the world of computer science, to insightful Substack writers, and a handful of more personal readings. Here's a look at what's been on my reading list:

## July 26, 2023
* **Mindstorms** by Seymour Papert is a seminal text in the field of education and computing. I've been revisiting the [first edition](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/http://worrydream.com/refs/Papert%20-%20Mindstorms%201st%20ed.pdf) and its powerful ideas still resonate today. 
* [Bret Victor's "Beast of Burden"](http://worrydream.com/#!/LearnableProgramming) is a remarkable introduction to programming that reimagines how we learn and understand coding.
* Alongside these, I've been catching up on some [programming lessons](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming) from Khan Academy, offering a nice balance of practical and theoretical knowledge.
* [Eve's approach to teaching programming](http://play.witheve.com/#/examples/quickstart.eve) offers some intriguing ideas about making coding more accessible.
* I also took a look at [Chris Lattner's Resum√©](https://nondot.org/sabre/Resume.html#writing) - the man behind LLVM and Swift has quite an impressive career trajectory!
* Lastly, I've got to follow up on [DHS Form 7001](https://www.dhs.gov/topic/cis-ombudsman/forms/7001#no-back) for case assistance with Homeland Security - some real-life admin mixed in with the reading!

## July 25, 2023
* Switching gears, I've been engrossed by [Noah Smith's Substack](https://substack.com/@noahpinion). Smith is a popular writer who covers a wide array of topics, always with insightful commentary.
* I also took some time to [evaluate the LLM Model](https://lmsys.org/) over at LMSYS Org - always good to keep up-to-date with different learning models and systems.

## July 22, 2023
* As part of my personal commitment to healthy eating, I discovered a treasure trove of [vegan low-carb recipes](https://vegangela.com/tag/low-carb/) over at Vegangela. Yum!
* On a more serious note, I read through the guide on [Brain Cancer for the Newly Diagnosed](https://virtualtrials.org/Guide/BrainTumorGuidev12.pdf?fbclid=IwAR0gEVQBVJR7QSV840JdVdlYj-zKTNDNIlAFMSMNPDakZMmu5vej9rJK5xk_aem_AeyFSF30lvMls_vAz6znrhAivbaY1L6AV_pWzRm2QzEOgPvwcpqGdd7t0IMLseFpBZE). It's important to stay informed about these serious issues.

That's it for this week. I'll be back next week with more insights and explorations from my reading journey. Happy reading to you too!
