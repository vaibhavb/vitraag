[![TajMahal]({{site.images}}/2011/04/TajMahal_thumb.jpg)]({{site.images}}/2011/04/TajMahal.jpg)Another installment of a pic and a poem :

 

“Smiles light up the day

 

Taj Mahal is lit by morning rays

 

It’s a unique creation you might say

 

A hope near the river, a dedication to love

 

May be its an impulse to highlight the mundane

 

A masterpiece to celebrate the cliché

 

Let smiles light up the day!”
