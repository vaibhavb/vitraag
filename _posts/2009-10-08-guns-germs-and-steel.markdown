[Jared Diamond](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Diamond) makes a case that our recent history has been shaped by [Guns, Germs and Steel](http://www.amazon.com/Guns-Germs-Steel-Fates-Societies/dp/0393038912%3FSubscriptionId%3D0G81C5DAZ03ZR9WH9X82%26tag%3Dvaibhavb%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0393038912). In this century we have seen in various ways how Guns, Germs and Steel wield their power. Currently, we are dealing with one such power fit of *Germs*. They say, flu is in the air, beware!

 

Earlier this year I had made a [post](http://healthblog.vitraag.com/2009/04/swine-flu-crisis-management/) about tracking Swine Flu using Ushahidi’s software. Various folks online have tried to help raise awareness of the pertinent epidemic, most noticeably [CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/) has launched a comprehensive website [flu.gov](http://www.flu.gov/) to inform us better. Microsoft has launched the [H1N1 Response Center](http://apps.healthvault.com/app5) and Google is helping through [Flu trends](http://www.google.org/flutrends/).

 

Most common flu is the seasonal flu, which every year takes a toll of about **36,000** lives from late fall (Nov) to early Spring (March) and effects about 5-20 percent of population. This season we have a risk for a getting hit by swine flu ([H1N1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H1N1)) which can cause more deaths, and there is an even deadlier version – the avian flu ([H5N1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1)).

 

**So what should you do?**

 

  
  * Wash your hands and avoid close contact with sick people. 
   
  * Consider taking the Flu shot from a facility [near](http://flu.gov/individualfamily/vaccination/locator.html) you
