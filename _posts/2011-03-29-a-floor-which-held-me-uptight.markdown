Another installment of the pic and a poem -
<pre>
“A home which fit just right and a floor which held me uptight
A brooding ground which helped me stretch and strain
Tons of memories which survive
And a staircase which led to a whole world inside
A home which fit just right and a floor which held me uptight!”
</pre>
