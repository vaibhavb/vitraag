Alrite summer is just around the corner! Its the time we folks in Northwest look forward to! The entire misery of dark winters and rainy days is worth the gorgeous 3 months of summer we get around here!

 

I have been meaning to do a few outdoorsy things this summer, and wanted to started chalking my list here so that friends and family can join in, talk me in to and out of few things :) -

 

  
  * **_Rock-climbing & Bouldering_**              
    * A weekend bouldering trip to Squamish! 
       
    * Climbing as many single-pitch 5.8s as I can. May be pick up Exit-38 Wednesdays! 
       
    * **Goal:** Outer space (?) (July 2nd week or Aug 2nd week) – Outer space is a six pitch climb near Leavenworth, and it has been my goal since i started cragging a couple of years ago. Given my space and rock-climbing touch, it might not happen this year but still a worthy goal.             

       
   
  * **_Mountaineering_** -              
    * Mt. Adams (June 19th?) 
       
    * Mt. Baker (June 26th) 
       
    * Mt. Shuskan (?) 
       
    * **Goal:** Lead a trip up Mt. Rainier (July 17th), may be two 
       
    * **Goal:** One ice-climb, may be Mt. Hood late in the season (Aug 1st week?)             

       
   
  * **_Cycling _**             
    * Flying Wheels Summer Century! (June 12th) 
       
    * **Goal:** Lead a week-long trip along Oregon Coast (week of July 24th), in preparation to India biking adventure.             

       
   
  * **_Motorcycling _**             
    * Now that i still have my SV650s for this season I would love to do some long riding and track days with it. I have already been eyeing some [routes](http://www.roadsnw.com/western-washington-roads). 
       
    * **Goal:** Do at-least one long ride and one track day!             

       
   
  * **_Backpacking _**             
    * Yosemite (?) (Late summer Aug(?)) 
       
    * Need suggestions and friends to go with!            

       
   
  * **_Hiking & Camping_**              
    * Granite Mountain 
       
    * Camp Muir 
       
    * **Goal**: At-least do one camping trip with friends             

       
   
  * **_Try a new activity_**              
    * Rafting down Yakima river! (July 4th –?) 
       
    * Sea-kayaking or Sailing 
       
    * **Goal:** Learn to swim in open water 
       
 

May be I should make a outdoor activities calendar. Making it public is a little itchy but hey its summer in the northwest!!
