I'm sure most people haven't heard of "Masonry". Masonry is an ancient fraternity, so called way to re-discover oneself. Abraham Lincoln, Benjamin Franklin, Goethe belonged to the Masonic order. Its rumored that George Bush and Dick Cheney also come from Masonic Lodge/ Temple.

So like me you are puzzled; Whats this Masonry all about?
