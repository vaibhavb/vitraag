![](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61TcsNJ7n9L._SX311_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)The week-long Jain Paryushan ended with Festival of Forgiveness today. As [every year](http://ramblings.vitraag.com/2014/08/31/festival-of-forgiveness-2014/)Â I wish to ask for you to let go of my mistakes.

Like [last year](http://ramblings.vitraag.com/2014/08/26/the-sramanas-embracing-spiritual-hacking/), this year I decided to focus the week on some spiritual reading, and reflecting.

I picked up the book Siddhartha by Herman Hesse. This is a very well written book on the journey of spirituality. Siddhartha after being a Brahmin, Shraman, Buddha's disciple starts on a journey of this own with this quote -- "Neither Yoga-Veda shall teach me any more, nor Atharva-Veda, nor the ascetics, nor any kind of teachings. I want to learn from myself, want to be my student, want to get to know myself, the secret of Siddhatha!"

In addition, to reading I'm doing some writing, I intend to keep up a very short writeup of my beliefs and ethics, and test it overtime. I got inspiration for it from this [Codex](https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/Codex.md).

Well on to next spiritual year!
