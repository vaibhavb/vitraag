Being a non-native English speaker and writer as you can read my writings, they are not perfect. The way i choose to write is very conversational and grammatically incorrect. However, I'm taking up a New years' commitment to improve grammar, diction and clarity of my writings.   
  
I tend to use simple, direct sentences but i dont vary the length of the sentences not do i mix clauses to sound them interesting. So inspired by some advice from Strunk and White, I'm going to try and experiment with my writing style.   
  
One other problem I run in to is I dont tend to think the way i write. Infact, sometimes i think in several different languages (including symbols), this being a by-product of growing to learn 3-4 languages. I'm going to try and think as I write and force myself to think the way i write. I hope that this exercise will improve the clarity and thought process of my written work, and may be also improve the way I think.  
  
So here it is New Years' resolution #1 - improve grammer, diction and clarity of my writings.
