As we enter our 40s and beyond, maintaining fitness becomes increasingly important for long-term health and vitality. Regular fitness assessments help establish baselines, track progress, and identify areas for improvement. The following tests provide a comprehensive evaluation of key fitness components that are crucial for healthy aging.

These simple, equipment-minimal tests can be performed at home and offer valuable insights into your cardiovascular health, strength, balance, and overall functional fitness.

#### The Dead Hang
Grip strength is strongly correlated with cardiovascular health and reduced risk of heart and respiratory diseases. Simply hang from a pull-up bar with your arms fully extended. The goal is to maintain this position for 60 seconds or more, which indicates excellent grip strength and upper body endurance.

#### The Cooper Test
This is a widely-used test of aerobic fitness that estimates your VO2 Max - the maximum amount of oxygen your body can utilize during exercise. Find a track and run or walk for exactly 12 minutes, measuring the total distance covered. The formula is: VO2Max = Distance (in miles) Ã— 35.97 - 11.3. For example, covering 1.5 miles in 12 minutes yields a VO2Max of approximately 43, which is considered excellent. Age-calibrated results are available [here](https://marathonhandbook.com/the-cooper-test/#what-is-a-good-cooper-test-score).

#### The Plank and Push-Up Tests
**Plank Hold:** Maintain a plank position with your back straight and core engaged. Aim for at least one minute, with three minutes or more being exceptional.

**Push-Ups:** Perform as many standard push-ups as possible with proper form. More than 25 repetitions is considered excellent for most age groups.

#### Lower Body Strength
The [Single Leg Calf Raise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tla2ScHQgu0) test evaluates lower leg strength and stability. The target is to complete 25-30 repetitions on each leg, which indicates good functional strength for daily activities.

#### Balance Test
Test your balance by performing daily activities on one leg, such as putting on shoes or socks. This functional assessment helps identify balance deficits that could increase fall risk as we age.
