As a certified penetration tester, conducting comprehensive annual security assessments requires a structured methodology that balances thorough coverage with practical execution. This guide outlines the essential testing procedures, tools, and automation strategies needed to deliver actionable security insights that protect your clients' critical assets throughout the year.


## Infrastructure Pentest

Infrastructure penetration testing forms the foundation of any comprehensive security assessment, targeting the underlying systems, networks, and cloud environments that support business operations.
