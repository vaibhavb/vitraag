The Silicon Valley Cybersecurity Summit proved to be an insightful gathering, offering a glimpse into the current trends and challenges in the cybersecurity landscape.  One notable takeaway was the recurring theme of "unknowns."  Several speakers highlighted the difficulty organizations face in identifying all potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors within their ever-expanding digital footprint. This emphasis on the unknown underscored the need for proactive and continuous monitoring, as opposed to reactive security measures.

### Notes on Talks

#### Emerging Threats Panel
The panel consisted of active security researchers who provided valuable insights into the ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats. Their expertise offered a crucial perspective on the latest attack vectors, techniques, and the evolving tactics employed by malicious actors.

#### Unknown Unkowns Talk by ConductorOne 
This presentation introduced the concept of "NIH" - Non-Human Identity. The talk highlighted the significant number of orphaned resources and accounts within organizations, emphasizing the critical need for better visibility and control over these assets to mitigate security risks.

#### Agentic AI Talk by SwimLane
This presentation explored the potential of Agentic AI in cybersecurity. Agentic AI, with its capabilities for hyper-automation and autonomous operation, can revolutionize threat detection and analysis. The presentation showcased how these AI-powered agents can significantly enhance security posture and improve response times to incidents

### Misc Notes
