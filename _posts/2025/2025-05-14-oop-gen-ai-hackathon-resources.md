* [Bay Are Patient Advocates Use cases]( https://www.vitraag.com/2024/06/21/omacare/)
* [Parrot Medical Record Summaries](https://www.parrot.us/medical-record-summaries) - This service, now part of Filevine, provides AI-generated summaries of medical records. While used in a legal context (for depositions and case review), the ability to summarize complex medical information can empower patients or their advocates to better understand their health history and treatment, fitting within a broad definition of patient advocacy by improving access to and comprehension of health information.


**3. Medical Scribe / Voice etc.**

* [Heidi Health](https://www.heidihealth.com/) - Search results indicate Heidi Health is an AI medical scribe service designed to help clinicians with documentation, indirectly supporting patient care and potentially impacting personal health experiences through improved clinical workflows. While primarily a B2B tool for healthcare professionals, its ultimate goal is to enhance patient interactions and care delivery.
* [The Superbill](https://www.thesuperbill.com/) - Eligibility verificaiton automated with AI.

**4. AI Data**

* [Google Health AI Developer Foundations](https://developers.google.com/health-ai-developer-foundations) - This page is explicitly about the foundational resources for developers working with AI in the health sector, directly relating to AI development and the data/tools involved.
* [OpenAI Healthbench](https://openai.com/index/healthbench/) - This refers to a benchmark for evaluating AI models on health-related tasks, which is directly tied to the performance and capabilities of AI models, often evaluated using specific datasets (AI Data).
* [OpenAI Simple Evals GitHub](https://github.com/openai/simple-evals) - This GitHub repository contains tools for evaluating OpenAI models. While not raw data, these tools are essential for assessing the performance of AI models on various tasks, including those that might be health-related, and are intrinsically linked to how AI is developed and validated using data.

**5. Ideas from VCs**

* [Y Combinator Requests for Startups (RFS)](https://www.ycombinator.com/rfs) - This is a direct link to Y Combinator's "Requests for Startups" page, where the prominent VC firm outlines business ideas they are interested in funding. This fits perfectly into the "Ideas from VCs" category.
