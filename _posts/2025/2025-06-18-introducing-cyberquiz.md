Cybersecurity education requires effective tools for student assessment and engagement. In today's rapidly evolving cybersecurity landscape, hands-on learning and assessment tools are crucial for educating the next generation of cyber defenders. That's why I'm excited to share **CyberQuiz** - a comprehensive, open-source quiz platform specifically designed for cybersecurity education. I used this tool for all my classes in 2025.
