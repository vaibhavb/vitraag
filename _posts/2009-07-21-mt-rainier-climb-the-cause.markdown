I thought I would take a moment and elaborate on my personal and professional causes which I would like to evangelize as part of my climb. 

 

**_Personal _**

 

Earlier I got email from [Aparajita](http://www.ashanet.org/seattle/events/woc/profile_head.php?p=aparajitad) suggesting like Alok’s [Rainier Climb](http://www.ashanet.org/seattle/events/climb/profile_head.php?alok), I should fundraise for Asha. I like Asha’s cause and zero-overhead approach, so please donate for [Asha](http://www.ashanet.org/seattle) to support my climb. Asha has supported a project in my hometown in India – the [Mayaboli school for hearing impaired](http://vitraag.blogspot.com/2005/12/mayaboli-school-for-hearing-impaired.html). For those who know me and would like to personally donate for this cause I would be really happy to receive donations for the same. This is the same school for which I fundraised in my [last Rainier climb](http://vitraag.blogspot.com/2006/08/mt-rainier-blissful-climb.html). Please note unlike the general Asha the donations for Mayaboli are not 509(c)3 and hence not tax deductible[![images](http://lh6.ggpht.com/_Jc7k7_ysg2g/Sl04SYIfp1I/AAAAAAAAEvI/CS0k1kmchUM/images%5B13%5D.jpg?imgmax=800)](mailto:vaibhavb@vitraag.com&subject=Supporting your climb&body=hi Vaibhav, I pledge X dollars to support your cause for the Rainier Climb.).

**_Team Cause          
_**I also want to promote my team [HealthVault](http://www.healthvault.com/) and have this climb help spread the word about need to improve the state of health care, particularly the need for individual citizens to assert right to Health Data.
