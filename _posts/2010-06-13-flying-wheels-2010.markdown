Today I spent the an awesome sunny day cycling through Redmond, Duvall, Snohomish as past of the the Flying wheels summer century ride.

 

I have done this ride in twice before ([2006](http://www.flickr.com/photos/23752835@N00/sets/474729/) – 70miles, 2007 – 100 miles). I had a sort of deja vu from 2007 I started getting cramps around mile 70, but the good part of I’m quite happy with how i pushed myself. I learnt two things – 

 

1. Human body is amazing, if you push it can survive a lot of things. I ended up pushing through the last 3 miles hill with cramps, after a few pedals the cramps disappeared. 

 

2. Make sure your condition your muscles for performance not just endurance. I did hard run on Thursday and I was still sore from it. I should use my training time effectively, just like [Body by Science](http://ramblings.vitraag.com/2010/06/body-by-science/).

 

Anyways, the [Asha Team](http://www.ashanet.org/seattle/events/woc/index.php) and Emel (a friend from [Run, Dinner Social](http://ramblings.vitraag.com/2010/03/run-dinner-and-salsa/)) did awesome! Most riders finished the 65 mile loop, now folks are eyeing the STP. Emel did awesome on her first century beating me by a full hour!

 

**My stats:** Ride time 8 hours 20 min. No where good but given the conditions I’m very happy with how i pushed myself.

 

Now the pictures.
