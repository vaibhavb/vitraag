[![BelieveInMe]({{site.images}}/2011/04/BelieveInMe_thumb.jpg)]({{site.images}}/2011/04/BelieveInMe.jpg)

 

New week and another installment of pic and poem, inspired by [Believe in Me](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqArV6B173E), Future Trance, ATB.

 

 

<blockquote>  
> 
> “Believe in me, I can hold against the elements
> 
>    
> 
> I harness all that strength a rebar at a time
> 
>    
> 
> In vast sands of times, we have survived all the antagonists
> 
>    
> 
> Belief is the key element in addition to those five
> 
>    
> 
> Believe in me…”
>
