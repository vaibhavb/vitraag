So today was the official last day of the season! Unexpectedly after a really dead winter I ended up Snowboarding quite a bit in the spring, thanks to $99 season pass at Stevens!

 

The intent of this post is to summarize my improvements in Snowboarding skills. Overall i went about 5-6 times snowboarding this season, once in winter and rest of the time in spring!

#### Progress this season?

 

I definitely improved my skills and speed by trying to connect turns more graciously than forcing my back/gliding leg to get me on toe-side! Leaning forward and then gradually getting on to toe-side helped a lot in my speed and grace! In fact, this was the exact skills the lesson at Tahoe last year focused on. I didn’t go any gracious black this year but I ended up trying the terrain park at [Stevens pass](http://www.ridestevenspass.com/sites/ridestevenspass/upload/filemanager/map_trail_large.jpg), thanks to Jeff. I did a few 1-3 footer jumps, only to see the blue sky.

 

#### New gear this season?

 

Thanks to spring sale i finally bought a [Giro helmet](http://www.giro.com/en-us/products/snow-helmets/encore-2/) for under $40!

#### What I might try next season?

 

I’m an average intermediate snowboarder may be I’ll take a couple lessons next season to move up a notch, and possibly a vacation at Whistler to truly enjoy long runs! Meanwhile any tips to improve are welcome!

 

One of the joys of snowboarding is that you can get in to jumps pretty quickly, I know I'm pass my teens but may be next season I’ll try some jumps and my goal would be to at least do a 3 footer. 

 

One of the things I noticed this season is that eventually i might want to learn skiing, yah I know I give hard time to skiers :). No matter how long you snowboard you do fall, not so in skiing :), the ability of the skiers to do backcountry and also a lot harder stuff (read moguls) easily is tempting me to try skiing next season, we'll see.
