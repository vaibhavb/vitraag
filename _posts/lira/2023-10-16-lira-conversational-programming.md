Conversational programming refers to a programming approach that aims to make human-computer interactions more natural and intuitive, often by leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to allow users to interact with computers in a conversational manner, potentially making software more accessible to those without technical expertise.

Here is a alexa-style conversational programming approach, where the user is asked to provide a natural language query, and the computer responds with an appropriate response presented at [re-invent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrtHQ6ohcg)

Top research papers in this area often come from conferences like ACL, EMNLP, and NeurIPS, among others. Here are some influential papers:

* "Dialog-to-Action: Converting Conversational Dialogues to Executable Programs" - Various authors from Microsoft Research and University of Michigan
* "Conversational Program Synthesis" - Various authors, often affiliated with institutions like Stanford and MIT
* "Building Conversational Agents with Transformer Neural Networks" - Research from Google Brain
* "Towards End-to-End Learning for Dialog State Tracking and Management using Deep Reinforcement Learning" - Research from Facebook AI Research (FAIR)

As we build [LIRA](/code/lira), we are interested in exploring this area of conversational programming. We are also interested in exploring the use of Large Language Models (LMs) for conversational programming.
