Pretty interesting compilation technology. Volta splits MSIL across server and client according to through-put of the channel. However there is a bit of marketing push in the message saying that its great for web applications. The idea of compiling MSIL in to Javascript is quite interesting!! - this like walking the compiler theory backwards, more like reverse engineering! I would love to check this technology once its a little more mature, interesting idea never the less.
