Time and again it seems to be really really difficult to win people. I wonder what how trust incubates. We seem to trust people in about couple of minutes while even after a life-time one fails to trust a sincere person. Is trust a two way handshake? or Is it a culmination of events. Lessons in inter-personal phsychology!! :)
