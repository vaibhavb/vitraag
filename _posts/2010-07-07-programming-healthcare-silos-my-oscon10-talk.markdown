I’ll be presenting a talk called “[Programming HealthCare Silos](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2010/public/schedule/detail/15292)” at [Open Source Conference 2010](http://www.oscon.com) on July 23rd. I’m really excited about the talk, I feel honored to get an opportunity to present at OSCON. OSCON is a very prestigious venue, with a huge of mindshare in software community and who’s who on the attendee and [speaker list](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2010/public/schedule/grid). 

 

If you are planning to attend the conference do drop me a note, and perhaps some check-out my [talk](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2010/public/schedule/detail/15292). I’m also looking for audience for dry-runs of my talk..
