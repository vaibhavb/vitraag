I'm in process of fixing my old Toshiba A65 laptop, apparently it shuts down after overheating. It seems to be a very commong problem  and [http://www.laptoprepair101.com/laptop/2006/01/04/toshiba-laptop-overheating/](http://www.laptoprepair101.com/laptop/2006/01/04/toshiba-laptop-overheating/) has a very guide to fix it. I'm in process of following it, so far i have removed the harddisk and the cards, next is taking the chassis apart :). Hopefully the problem is clogged heatsink and cleaning it will help resolve the issue. I want to give the computer to mom to pair it with the desktop, and replace her already departed Viao :)!!
