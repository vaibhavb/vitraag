By mere fluke I stumbled in to tickets for Feb. 20 Ice Hockey 4:30 PM at [Canada Hockey Place](http://www.canadahockeyplace.com/). We don’t have accommodation yet was considering a day trip, but that will be crazy! Let me know if any of you guys are up for sharing accommodation in Vancouver around Feb 19, 20.
