[This ](http://www.iunknown.com/2008/03/open-source-amb.html)post by John Lam, highlights the change of tide at Microsoft. The company is actively trying to court opensource, notable measures in this direction are:




    
  * See the code - Opensourcing [.NET framework](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/01/16/net-framework-library-source-code-now-available.aspx)

    
  * Resources for interoperating - The Opensource interoperability lab

    
  * Support opensource - The [Dynamic Languages Runtime](http://blogs.msdn.com/mmaly/archive/2008/03/23/dlr-beta-1.aspx)



Well, you might argue that these are tactical moves and not a strategy. I let that be dictated by time and persuasion ....
