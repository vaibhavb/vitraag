I wish to start this blog by [pointing](http://www.abdulkalam.com/) folks to the detailed vision of APJ Abdul Kalam to make India a developed Nation by 2020AD.

In an India striven by many controversies APJ's [book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0140278338/qid=1095029793/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/103-6165539-0433429?v=glance&s=books) presents a vision acceptable to majority of Indians. The Vision Of Equalling The Progress Of The S0-Called Developed Nations In Our Life-times. This brings us to the point that is this possible? Who will do it? I dont want to the answer the question of wether this is possible as the book mentions a lot about it, but really do we have an option? Hope for achieving the success which eluded the nation is the hope for happiness for each Indian.

As most of us have realized our culture and problems are unique. We are culture so divided (on religion, food, festivals, calendar, etc!!) that its really difficult to say what an Indian cultural stereotype is? The only thing which truly binds us is poverty, hunger, lack of resources, belief in SuperNatural powers and belief that someday it will all be good!! So yep! is the "all good" end possible without each one of us contributing to it? Can we expect magical powers to feed soon to be 150 crore Indians? So yes there is little for each one of us to do.

So am i talking about benevolence and giving? Hmm..not really, those things dont really succeed to uplift of a society in long term. I am talking about driving a cultural change, en-visioning a culture which supports and nurtures bold leaders. Indians get really poor grades on team work, and this is something which most culture have inbuilt in them. We realize that the divide and rule paradigm combined with the numberous divisions based on caste, religion, belief .... have been driving culprits to make sure we never get what team work is about. So lets think about how we can bring changes to build team work in our culture (yes! after numerous futile attempts to run away from it I have to identify myself as India:)). I am sure that most of us have really great ideas for get the team thing in our breed. This post is meant to be a starting point for the same discussion. So lets be the change which we want to see .... bring our skills, motivations (whatever they might be... including moentary profit) and identities to build a developed nation in our life times!!! Its we who bear the burden.

cheers,

Vaibhav
