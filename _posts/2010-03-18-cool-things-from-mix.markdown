Even before I do my [HIMSS](http://himssconference.org/) post I felt compelled to talk about the shiny things from [Mix](http://www.visitmix.com) 2010.

 

  
  * **_Windows Phone 7 Series Developer Studio_** – I love the free tools provided to develop for Windows Phone. Love the fact that Silverlight and XNA studio are very thoughtfully and seamlessly working with-in Visual Studio Express. The developer studio is lean and performant, its great to see the tool tips for Pixel widths right in the design surface. I was able to write a simple Health app in about 10 mins, the Phones are not out yet but the

  * **Open Data Protocol** : Very interesting competition to GData :). OData - [http://www.odata.org/](http://www.odata.org/) is a combination of AtomPub with data-typing and querying conventions. OData is supported out of the box by Windows Azure services, and Netflix launch an API powered by OData - [http://odata.netflix.com/Catalog/](http://odata.netflix.com/Catalog/). It will be great to learn more about batching and syncing aspects of this protocol (Interestingly Microsoft Sync Platform also launched an asymmetric syncing capability). 
   
  * **Data Relay** : MySpace which is the largest .NET site open sourced their middle-tier GU - [http://datarelay.codeplex.com/](http://datarelay.codeplex.com/). DataRelay has a framework for message passing, transaction management on top of a performant caching system. Apparently it uses The CCR ([Concurrency and Coordination Runtime](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb648752.aspx)) from Microsoft Robotic Studio :). 
   
  * A very interesting [presentation](http://live.visitmix.com/MIX10/Sessions/EX15) of building your own **MVVM framework** – I love the use of Continuations and a programming model where the framework takes care of concurrency and events! The presenter is author of Caliburn - [http://www.codeplex.com/caliburn](http://www.codeplex.com/caliburn). 
   
  * **Font**-ing it out – For a font newbie like me, all i know about Fonts I learnt from Kevin Larsons presentation : [http://live.visitmix.com/MIX10/Sessions/DS07](http://live.visitmix.com/MIX10/Sessions/DS07)
