I’m a burner and no-where close to carbon-neutral, I also come from Jain faith which believes in extreme sustainability ([Samavasarana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samavasarana)). The thought of this article is to write about personal sustainability projects which I can do to take tiny steps towards a better tomorrow, I welcome you, my reader, to contribute and participate.




First of all the word sustainable is un-sustainable, here is a parody from XKCD.

XKCD Parody

So what are the projects I would do?






  1. Easy to use sustainable **power** at Burning Man — A lot has been written by [b-org](https://journal.burningman.org/2015/12/black-rock-city/leaving-no-trace/sustainability-at-burning-man-the-next-chapter/) about this as well as few dated [articles](https://www.civicsolar.com/load-calculator) on the topic. The goal of this project would be to update and create template of energy surplus systems to be deployed on the playa **out of the box**.


  2. A compact and easy way to **carry spices** for a healthy meal — Something which is a mid-way of roll-up spices and a easy to carry travel jars.
