Myself and my esteemed colleague, [Ali Emami](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011/profile/124027) will be at [OSCON](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011) starting tomorrow. The [healthcare track](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011/public/schedule/topic/Healthcare) this year is packed with great content, we will be touching on [HealthVault and Microsoft’s participation in the Direct project](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011/public/schedule/detail/19573).

Last year I talked about [Programming Healthcare Silos](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2010/public/schedule/detail/15292), the Direct project is an innovative way to bridge the silos in Healthcare and provide a secure provider to provider and provider to patient mode of data exchange.

<!-- more -->If you are around stop by for the talk or come grab us of any relevant questions. We'll post the slides online after the talk.

I’m looking forward to the conference, and particularly to the talk on [personal data locker project](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011/public/schedule/detail/20081) and more. It has been a [pet peeve](http://ramblings.vitraag.com/2008/09/where-is-my-data-can-i-use-it-and-can-it-help-me/) of mine to build some akin to that, with the locker talk and more [awesomeness](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011/public/schedule/share/2a147fb7251577f134c7fbe2e27abd56) hopefully I’ll get to hacking on it soon!
