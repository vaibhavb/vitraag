We started at about 9:30am after getting off the houseboat to Cochin. Since the sun was up and the ride a bit long (about 83km) we got in to Ernakulam at 1pm.

I helped Tullika and Rahul get on their 7pm train to Bangalore from Ernakulam and also made a friend at the railway station.

Since my train was at 11pm i decided to do a bit of more night riding and go check out Fort Cochin. It was awesome to see the spirit of Christmas and New year in this old part of Cochin. It was lighted and had a huge Chrismas tree!!

My train started at about 11:20 pm (on time) to go to Bhatkal. I had a 90km ride the next day!!
