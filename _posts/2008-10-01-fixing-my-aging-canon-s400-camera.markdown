I vividly remember buying a pretty expensive ($450, if i remember correctly) 3 Megapixel [Canon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_%28company%29) S400 camera from [circuit city](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_City) back in 2004! and now for less than half the price you get twice a better camera.  
  
Anyhoo - my aging camera has begun to limp. Just after few minutes of use the batter dies. I have two [lithium ion batteries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium-ion_battery) and its the same with both. Also once in a while i do get memory card error. Its unlikely that my battery is dead, but it might be something which this [post ](http://www.pinoyhack.com/2006/09/14/canon-powershot-s400-fix/)points. So i'm going to try and reset the internal battery for the camera, if that fails my default plan is to contact [Canon](http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=PgComSmModDisplayAct&keycode=2112&fcategoryid=223&modelid=8777).
