[Fitness Challenge 2005](http://www.temple-telegram.com/health/challenge/exerplan.php?week=2) Describes a nice way of how exercise should be split up. I'm going to split the way I exercise in two One day do chest and back and Other day do Biceps, Triceps and Shoulders. Abs and Cardio should be done everyday.  
  
Primarliy I have to figure out more chest exercises. The above link has some nice suggestions which i should explorer.
