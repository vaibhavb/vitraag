[![MotoTour](http://vitraagblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/mototour.png)](http://vitraagblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/mototour.png)So I'm planning to do a motorcycle tour after a long time! I just bought a BMW 1150 RS, and this machine is now all decked up for a tour! The current plan is to tour 12-14 days, and head up from Seattle to Canadian Rockies, the Banff national park, then Glaciers national park and then finally end up in San Francisco after a visit to Yellowstone National park. I should perhaps call this a 2000 mile national parks pilgrimage tour!

I'm super excited about it, but I'm still finalizing the route and the journey details. Currently I'm pegging about 8 days on the route, and I have about 5 days which I need to disperse around. If you have any ideas, thoughts or suggestions please send them my way!
