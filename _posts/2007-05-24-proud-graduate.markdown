[![IMG_0511](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/200/511526933_2dc7128809_t.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/vaibhavb/511526933/)It was delightful to see Vaidehi graduate this weekend. I'm really proud of her, after her more than successful and eventful stunt at University Of Maryland, College Park she is going to join Cisco in Bay Area. While her MS in Telecommunications she successfuly pulled out the stunt of being in news twice, and doing lucheon with the Dean!! She has made our family proud, way 2 go gal!!!!
