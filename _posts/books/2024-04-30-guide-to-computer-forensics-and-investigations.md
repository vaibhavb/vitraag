## Overview
"Guide To Computer Forensics and Investigations" is a comprehensive textbook that provides detailed information and methodologies for conducting digital forensic investigations, I used it to teach CIS 60 - Introduction to Digital Forensics class at Merritt College. The authors cover a broad range of topics essential for students and professionals in the field of digital forensics, including how to set up a forensics lab, the tools and techniques used for data acquisition, and the legal considerations involved in forensic investigations.

## Themes
The book emphasizes several key themes:
- **Professionalism in Digital Forensics**: Highlighting the ethical considerations and standards required in the profession.
- **Technological Competence**: A focus on equipping readers with the knowledge to handle modern digital devices and software.
- **Practical Application**: Each chapter includes practical exercises and case studies to demonstrate the real-world application of theoretical concepts.

## Examples and Tools
The book provides examples and detailed explanations of various digital forensics tools. Here’s a brief overview from all chapters and appendices:
