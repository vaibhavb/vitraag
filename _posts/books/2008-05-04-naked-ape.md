In an effort to link all my online sites, I'm importing posts from some other places. Naked Ape is a book i read a couple of years.  
  
The Naked Ape, by Desmond Morris gives a perpective of an ape to human. We are not these super-species just an ape!! It touches the raw emotions and its at times very controversial but non the less a good read. It borrow it and read this as a recommendation by [Ruchi](http://www.linkedin.com/in/ruchibhargava).
