Book review of The Equation That Couldn't Be Solved by Mario Livio

![The Equation That Couldn't Be Solved](assets/images/books/the-equation-that-couldnot-be-solved.jpg)

## Overview
"The Equation That Couldn't Be Solved" by Mario Livio delves into the history and significance of the quintic equation—a polynomial equation of degree five—and the discovery that not all such equations can be solved with a straightforward algebraic solution. This realization marked a pivotal moment in mathematics, leading to the development of group theory and further innovations in the field.

## Key Themes
The book explores several key themes, including the nature of mathematical discovery, the evolution of algebra, and the impact of group theory on mathematics and beyond. Livio uses the stories of Évariste Galois and Niels Henrik Abel, two mathematicians who contributed significantly to the theory, to humanize these mathematical concepts and highlight the drama of their discoveries.

## Examples Used!
Livio provides numerous examples to illustrate complex mathematical ideas in an accessible manner. He discusses how the solutions to quadratic, cubic, and quartic equations were found, setting the stage for the problem of the quintic equation. The narrative then delves into group theory, explaining how this branch of mathematics provides a framework for understanding symmetries in nature and in mathematical objects.

The following table outlines the key techniques and examples used by the author.

## Conclusion
The book concludes with a reflection on the beauty and universality of mathematics, as revealed through the story of the quintic equation and group theory. Livio argues that these mathematical concepts not only advance our understanding of the mathematical world but also have practical applications in various fields, from physics to cryptography. He emphasizes the importance of curiosity and persistence in the pursuit of knowledge, celebrating the contributions of Galois, Abel, and others to our collective understanding of the universe.

Livio's work is a testament to the power of mathematical inquiry and the endless pursuit of answers to seemingly impossible questions. Through engaging storytelling and clear explanations, "The Equation That Couldn't Be Solved" makes a compelling case for the beauty and relevance of mathematics in the modern world.
