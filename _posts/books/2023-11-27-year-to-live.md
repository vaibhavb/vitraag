Book review of A Year To Live by Stephen Levine.

![A Year to Live Book Cover](assets/images/books/a-year-live-cover.jpg)

## Introduction
In my recent revisiting of Stephen Levine's profound work, "A Year to Live," I found myself immersed once again in its transformative narrative. This book, more than just a guide, invites readers on a journey of introspection and existential contemplation. I first read this book while I was in rehab as my mom was recovering, a time that deeply influenced my perspective on life and its fleeting nature.

## Summary
"A Year to Live" is based on a powerful premise: live each day as if it were your last year. Levine, through this thought experiment, encourages readers to explore their lives with a heightened sense of awareness and purpose. The book blends anecdotal experiences with practical exercises, guiding individuals towards a more meaningful existence. I particularly admired how Stephen Levine provides a 'recipe' for the year, including steps like relinquishing personal possessions and making a list of people to reach out to. Inspired by this, I began compiling a similar list for myself.

## Analysis and Evaluation
The exercise in the book where you are guided to write your own eulogy, particularly in the context of the last month of a hypothetical final year, stood out to you as very touching. This exercise seems to have offered you a profound and introspective experience, allowing you to reflect deeply on your life, values, and the legacy you wish to leave behind.

## Conclusion
"A Year to Live" by Stephen Levine is more than just a book; it’s a life lesson encapsulated in pages. The exercise of writing one's own eulogy, as I experienced, is particularly moving and transformative. It offers a rare opportunity for profound self-reflection and clarity about what truly matters in life. I highly recommend this book to anyone seeking deeper meaning in life or grappling with the concept of mortality. It’s a journey that promises to change how you view life, death, and the in-between. Personally, I am looking forward to rereading this book again at some point, continuing the journey of reflecting on the life I have.
