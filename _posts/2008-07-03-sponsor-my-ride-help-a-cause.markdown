Every year I do the [Seattle to Portland ](http://vitraag.blogspot.com/search/label/stp)bike ride as a part of fund raiser. Next weekend I will be testifying my bike + butt endurance skills for 202 miles between Seattle and Portland. If you are interested in supporting [Asha for Education](http://www.ashanet.org/seattle) and itâ€™s cause of bringing  change through education in India please support my ride by pledging and donating [here](http://www.ashanet.org/seattle/events/woc/profile_head.php?vaibhavb). One of very personally gratifying  things I was able to do with support of Asha was to help sponsor a [school for hearing impaired ](http://www.flickr.com/groups/mayaboli/)back in my home town.  
  
Enjoy the long weekend and happy Independence day.
