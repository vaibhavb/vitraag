With [Miyar Adventures](http://miyaradventures.com/trip-category/biking/) I'm hoping to offer some [guided bike rides](http://miyaradventures.com/trip-category/biking/) this summer through early fall.

**Currently  three trips are on the dock with flexible dates.**




    
  * Seattle to Vancouver Bike Ride (3 days):

I would love to gauge interest on this - please drop me a note if you would like to join.

I'm also game to host a seminar to go through the biking prep for long rides.
