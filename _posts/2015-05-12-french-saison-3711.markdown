Its rare when you walk to a bar you love the bear and the bartender tells you the recipe! Well thats what happened to me at [Outer Planet](http://www.outerplanetbrewing.com/). Jim was very gracious to share with me the fanciness of French Saison 3711 yeast used in their Saison Beer. This yeast brings a rich spiciness and citrus to the hops!




I’m planning to definitely experiment a whole bunch with [WYEAST Saison 3711](https://www.wyeastlab.com/rw_yeaststrain_detail.cfm?ID=199). It seems to do well with Belgian and French styles but do let me know if you have done anything interesting with it! I think next batch of brews need to kick soon ☺.
