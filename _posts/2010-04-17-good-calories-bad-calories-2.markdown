On Thursday I spent my afternoon listening to Gary Taubes at [University Of Washington](http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.com/2010/04/gary-taubes-speaks-this-thursday-at-uw.html). Gary is author of [Good Calories, Bad Calories](http://www.amazon.com/Good-Calories-Bad-Gary-Taubes/dp/1400040787%3FSubscriptionId%3D0G81C5DAZ03ZR9WH9X82%26tag%3Dzemanta-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D1400040787), and has had a very successful journalism career exposing bad science. His talk gave background and analysis of research on ‘science of why we get fat’. You can watch this talk [online](http://videomedia2.swedish.org/mediasite/Viewer/?peid=cd8c7aa15bc94a0486f4ee9b66ef8f8f).

 

I was attracted to Good Calories, Bad Calories sometime last year, primarily owing to my co-workers and friends ([Chris](http://christremonte.blogspot.com/), [Lowell](https://cisnotc.wordpress.com/) and Keith). Lowell is a very passionate ambassador of [low-carb diet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-carbohydrate_diet), he infact lost over 90 pounds in a year and a half by just changing his diet! The book is a dense read and I have barely finish first part.

 

I haven’t really switched to a [low-carb diet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-carbohydrate_diet), but Maris (specially) and myself have been looking in to ways to improve our vegetarian diets. The food in America is no way tuned for a healthy vegetarian diet. Maris researched on the protein aspects of the diet and came up with the idea of putting soy powder in curries. In fact she even bought a whole recipe book for [tofu powdered cooking](http://www.amazon.com/Tofu-1-2-3-Maribeth-Abrams/dp/0471748099). The next culinary exploration we are going to try is [vegetable smoothies](http://www.ehow.com/videos-on_833_make-vegetable-fruit-smoothies.html).

 

As you will notice all our exploration has been to add protein to our vegetarian diets and eat more of leafy vegetables. But what i would take away from Gary’s book and talk is to actually try reducing the bad carbohydrates in our diets especially **sugar, bread and white rice**! I did end up asking a question along these lines to Gary and his frank answer was that he is not a good spokesperson for a vegetarian low-carb diet (given that all his bread substitutes are meaty/fatty), however one of his strongest proponent and friend is a vegan and he has seen improvements in health by reducing carbohydrates.

 

**So what are bad carbohydrates?**

 

  
  * Starches (esp. Fructose) and Sugars
   
  * Bread 
   
  * Pasta 
 

**What should a vegetarian substitute these with?**

 

  
  * Soy products
   
  * Green leafy vegetables
 

**Any tips?**

 

  
  * Start by reducing rice and bread in diet in lieu of salad!
   
  * Introduce the morning vegetable breakfast smoothie !!
 

The strongest criticism of low-carb diet is that the fat substitutes (esp. meat) are bad for your heart and will increase risk for Heart Attack. For a vegetarian this is not really the case and any reduction is carb is good!! :).

 

Any suggestions for good calories for vegetarian? Feel free to comment away!!
