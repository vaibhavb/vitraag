We are having a snow induced holiday today in Seattle!! It snowed a lot yesterday afternoon and evening. I saw a bunch of car accidents on my way home on the free way! Basically everyone here has tough time driving in rain and now if you add snow, you bet things are going to go hay wire! The APLDC conference got cancelled today and every one at work is missing owing to hazardous driving conditions, but i'm here trying to spend time blogging and getting some work done before i head to not-so-snowy India.. :)...
