Last year I did an N-part series about working with HealthVault XML APIs. It was implemented with ruby on UBuntu Linux system using OpenSSL. I got time to go mark all those articles with next links and I thought i would summarize the series here:

  2. Part 2: [ Talking to HealthVault anonymously ](http://healthblog.vitraag.com/2008/04/talking-to-the-public-methods-of-healthvault-platform/)

One of our partners has also implemented [Drop Off Pick Up](http://blogs.msdn.com/familyhealthguy/archive/2008/07/15/super-simple-connectivity-with-dopu.aspx) solution in ruby using the above articles. Hopefully sometime in near future, I'll convince them to do a blog post about the same.
