Vaidehi came over for July 4th [weekend](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workweek). After all the busy weekends only this weekend i got some time to get the pictures ready and share the goodness. It was really fun time motorcycling, biking, salsa dancing, strolling and climbing with her and Maris. :).
