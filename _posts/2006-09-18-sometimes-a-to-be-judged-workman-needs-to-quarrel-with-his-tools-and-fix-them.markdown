Wow! thats a mouth-ful of a blog title! I'm spending most of active workhours today trying to improve the way i work with my tools! So yep - what are my tools and what do i do? Well I'm a programmer and a compiler, debugger and build system are my tools!!! So i need to constantly learn to make optimial use of these tools. But the real truth is that i'm a knowledge worker and i want to improve my workprocess to a level where i can effectively reutilize what i learn each time with minimal overhead, so that way my efficiency will increase. I'm thinking of writing few visual studio snippets which i can use each time i'm doing a familiar task, also have some stubs ready for testing and yep! design/prototype-design before i write :). Just a passing thought in my evolution as an engineer (?)!
