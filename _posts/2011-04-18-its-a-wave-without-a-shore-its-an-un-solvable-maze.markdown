Another installment of pic and poem, inspired by Caravan to Timbuktu by Pt. Hariprasad Chaurasia

<pre> 
“It’s a maze
You wake up in a gaze
To be part of the maze
This one does not have a start nor an end
But you are part of the maze
There are lines and corners
Make a left or right
Caravan or ride alone
It’s a wave without a shore
Its an un-solvable maze”
</pre>
