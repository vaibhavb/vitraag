I have not been very meticulous about doing regular posts, a lot has happened in last six months or so. I released a book, [Enabling Quantified Self with HealthVault](http://www.enablingprogrammableself.com); left Microsoft, started my experiments with cocktail making (Libar), and had a tryst with embassies!

 

All of the above are great topics to post about! What’s your favorite one for me to belabor? Well I guess I’m back from blogging hiatus and hopefully summer will be here soon too :).
