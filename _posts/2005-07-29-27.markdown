Yep! I'm dancing more:). This time is quick lessons in [Rumba](http://dancevision.com/files/video/SRM23/56k.wmv) and [Waltz](http://dancevision.com/files/video/SRM27/56k.wmv) at Danceworks studio.

Rhumba is one of those [shaky latin dances](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhumba) with the basic step to trace a box. Its


    
    Slow-------QuickQuick
    (1, L)          (2,3, RL)
    |                    |
    (5,6,LR)         (4, R)
    QuickQuick-------Slow



The instruction video in the link above show a different way of Rhumba but above one is what I learned. Its more Waltiz and less shaky ;). The

Waltz is the [founding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waltz) father (or mother) of ballroom dances. The basic step is a box step with uniform beats no quickies like rumba:


    
    Slow-------SlowSlow
    (1, L)       (2,3, RL)
    |                 |
    (5,6,LR)       (4, R)
    SlowSlow-------Slow



Remember to hold the Women at shoulder blade and look in eyes. Smiles make dacing fun :). Waltz is a romantic slow moving progressional dance. Progressional implies that you more with your partner through the dance floor (mostly in counterlclockwise way).

Thats all for Dance-101 as of now :).
