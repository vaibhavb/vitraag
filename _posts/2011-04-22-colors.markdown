Another installment of pic and poem inspired with [Green to black](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cj6jhbeTTp0) by Rebelution -

<pre> 
“Life takes a new corner
Spring brings the colors on
Chill it is when green turns to black
Spring prospers green
Its not just the color but the message in between
Rejuvenation is what we stand for”
</pre>
