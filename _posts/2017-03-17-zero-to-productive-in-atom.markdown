The best feature about Atom is that it has an easy to use project tree view for looking at files in the folder and working on code in a directory structure. This one feature had me shift from Vi to Atom.




The next useful part of any editor is keyboard shortcuts and intuitive editing. I get by with the modes in Vi, but love the idea of e-lisp functions. With **cmd+shift+p** one can search and execute existing commands.




I haven’t used snippets much in the past but an integration with terminal (i.e bash) is what I’ll be exploring next.




I do like atom get to know screen, its very succinct and gets the user acquainted with the powers of a modern, extensible and hackable editor using the best of web technologies on a local platform!
