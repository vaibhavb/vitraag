I had a great time interacting with folks at [Hacking 4 Health](http://healthblog.vitraag.com/2010/08/hacking-for-health/). The response for the event was amazing, it was very heartening to see 18 presentations from just a day of hacking. Folks worked on all sorts of interesting data mash-up ideas ([1](http://h4h.healthtap.com/pages/ideas),[2](http://spreadsheets.google.com/a/healthtap.com/ccc?key=0Ai_OElbGgV0sdE43eThUeVZyNi1GZ2hVTmpsM0E1QlE&hl=en&authkey=CJaQmsIG#gid=0)), but the one I would like to highlight are --

 

  
  * OskiHealth -- Using data from [CHDI](http://www.hhs.gov/open/discussion/chdi.html) and information on fast food restaurants in each county to show a color coded map of health of counties.
   
  * Healthy Commute -- Using data from [Factual](http://www.factual.com/), some engineers built a way to discover healthier commuting routes!
 

Ron has a [good summary](http://www.healthtap.com/2010/09/hundreds-participate-in-healthtaps-first-ever-health-hackathon/) of the event as well. Check out the pictures of the event at -- [http://www.flickr.com/photos/healthtap/](http://www.flickr.com/photos/healthtap/). Thanks to the good folks from Healthtap and Health2.0 for spearheading the event!
