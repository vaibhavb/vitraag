Today is the last day to get healthcare for 2017. As a self-employed there are limited choices and options.




Following are resources I used:  
1. State Health Exchange: WA has a pretty good plan finder tool — [https://www.wahealthplanfinder.org](https://www.wahealthplanfinder.org)!   
2. Commercial tools : [e-healthinsurance](http://www.ehealthinsurance.com) offers a good tool, however I like [stridehealth](http://www.stridehealth.com) better.  
3. Learning tools: I was confused especially with HSA, BBT offers a good [explanation](https://www.bbt.com/banking/savings/hsa-eligibility-worksheet.page) of HSA eligibility.
