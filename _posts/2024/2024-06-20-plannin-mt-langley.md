### Route

![Langley Route]((/assets/images/2024/langleyhike-2024.jpg){: width="400px" height="400px" align="center"})

Will possibly choose new Army pass (~ 23 miles) since the snow on it will be likely less than old Army pass (~19 miles). This will add some additional mileage to the trip. We will camp at the Long Lake -- Base of New Army pass. The hike to base is mostly easy and flat.

- Day 1 we hike about 9 miles with elevation gain of about 1000ft
- Day 2 we hike 17 miles & elevation gain of about 4900ft

We start from [Cottonwood Lakes Walk In Campground](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/inyo/recarea/?recid=20692), [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cottonwood+Lakes+Walk+in+Campground/@36.4528607,-118.1714253,17z/)
