##Concepts

| Strategy           | Definition                                                                                       |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Divide-and-conquer | Learn multiple theories each of which specializes to fit part of the data very well              |
| Occamâ€™s Razor      | Avoid overfitting by minimizing description length, which can include replacing fitted constants by simple integers or fractions. |
| Unification        | Try unifying learned theories by introducing parameters                                          |
| Lifelong Learning  | Remember learned solutions and try them on future problems                                       |
