# Nutritional Supplements
Skepticism is the main thought I have had when it comes to nutritional supplements. However, based on blood tests and suspectibility to illnesses like cardio-vascular disease and diabetes following are some of the supplements. For each of them I mention, my basis for the research. However, I still need more evidence from blood tests to prove efficacy of any of them.

- [Blueprint Essential Capsules]() - These capsules provide essential vitamins, CoQ10 (to prevent heart illness), Glucaraphanic converts to Sulfophrance (which is [documented](https://examine.com/supplements/sulforaphane/) to prevent cancer), Spermidine (researched to increase longevity in mice). Bryan Johnson has much more on his regimen and a good review of these is done by [near](https://near.blog/blueprint-1-0-review/)
- [Ashwagandha](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08L98KD8K) - I take it in powered form in my protein shake. It is known to cause some stomach upset but I do fine with it.
- [Triphala](https://www.amazon.com/Jiva-USDA-Organic-Triphala-Powder/dp/B01N3MOHE8) - Triphala is mix of Amla, Bhabitki and Haritaki. Its known to help with digestion. I take 1 tbsp in my protein shake.
- [Vitamin D](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001N4JYX6) - In addition to Blueprint Essential I like the liquid form as Vitamin D3 help with bone strenthg. I take in liquid form in my protein shake.
- [Wheatgrass](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0788YN5XG) - 1 tbsp in protein shake known to help with Digestion.
- [Protein Powder](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00J074W94/) - Well its pea protein, essential to helps with daily protein intake for a vegeterian.
- [Astaxanthin](https://www.amazon.com/Strength-Astaxanthin-Organic-Coconut-Absorption/dp/B07V574YYY) - This support skin health through antioxidant activity and is all natural. I've actually seen good skin results from it, Bryan Johnson also takes a version of this. Update: Q1, 2025
- [Magnesium 380mg](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OHRT7GA) - After sometimes getting cramps from running, I started taking Magnesium for Muscle health and its proving to be useful (no clinical/ blood work proof yet). Update: Q1, 2025
