A photo log of my Hawaii Travels.

## Kokohead Crater Hike {#kokohead}

An intense but rewarding hike up the Kokohead Crater railway trail. The steep climb on the old railway ties tests your endurance, but the panoramic views of Hanauma Bay and the southeastern shore of Oahu make every step worth it.
