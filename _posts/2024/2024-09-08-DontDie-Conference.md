On  Sunday, September 8, I attended the Delong Conference, hosted by Brian Johnson, titled *Don’t Die*. It was fascinating to spend the day surrounded by people exploring various methods to improve their health. I listened to several conversations and took notes on many of them. Notable sessions I attended included:

- Reclaiming Your Sleep Superpower
- Unlocking Skin Health
- The Role of Microplastics
- Longevity Network States
- Behavior Design
- Generative AI
- Human Stem Cells
- The Health Dataset of the Future

### Key Questions from the Conference:
- What if you had an algorithm to live forever?
- Why do we treat disease and not aging?
- Why do we follow basic advice on diet, exercise, meditation, and sleep?

### Memorable Quotes:
- “Survival of the curious.”
- “Life is lived in movement.”
- “Optimistic in general, skeptic in specific.”

### Lessons Learned:
I learned about the “DUNEDIN Pace Test” and a unique village, Vitalia, created by Prospera in 2021 with the motto "make death optional." Meditation sites were discussed as aging clocks. You can even calculate your aging using ChatGPT, and there is a notable paper on aging titled *TNIK*.

### Interesting Habits:
From various conversations, several habits stood out:
- No carbs in the evening
- Consider creating your own supplement regimen with creatinine.
- Take a VO2 max test
