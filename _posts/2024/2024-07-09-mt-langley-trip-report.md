Last weekend (July 28-30, 2024), 16 for us training with the Asha for Education, Silicon Valley hiking program hiked Mt. Langley via the New Army pass. This was a target hike for the fundraising program! I'm happy to share that we successfully completed the target. The group tained for more than 8 weeks and 15 out of 16 reached the summit but all 16 of us had a great trip (which is more important the summit!). We had a diverse group with the oldest of us being 65 years old, and for 11 of us this was our first 14er!!

This post is a trip report to summarize not just our journey but also the training and movtivation.

## Why ?
### Why Langley?
We have done other 14ers like [Mt. Shasta](https://www.vitraag.com/2019/06/26/a-journey-to-summit-mt-shasta-trip-report/) as part of Asha for Education's Silicon Valley hiking program, the 14er is typically the first big mountain hiked by the participant. To make this goal accessible to more diverse beginner participants and also to enable it for later in life atheles we chose Mt. Langley sitting at [14,032 ft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Langley). The mountain is less technical without any glaciers but also a testament to the beauty of Mother nature with amazing views and lakes. A perfect goal encompassing strenousity and beauty!

### Why Asha?
[Asha for Education](https://www.ashanet.org) is a 501(c)(3) organization, with an audacious goal to enable universal primary education in India by 2047! It works with a network for 50+ chapters world wide of primarily volunteers and no full-time staff to enable it!

What better way to combine these two objectives via the Silicon Valley chapers [Asha Hiking Program](https://sv.ashanet.org/team-asha-hiking-2024/). This year the program in addition to Mt. Langley is providing option to backpack Hetch Hetchy or so high-altitude day hikes in Colorado Rockies!

## Training Program!
With over 40+ participants in this hiking program training from Mar 23 till now over several weeks a group of coords, mentor make sure they adhete to weekly hike goals and checkpoints. Most notably every participant in the program going up to Mt. Langley did two progress checks (one with a heavy backpack) and also go familiar with overnight camping!

The elaborate training program made sure the participants are both physically and mentally ready for the hike!

We also made sure that participants are familiar with their equipment and especially for Mt. Langley they carry appropriate mosquito repellents, and water supply. Here is what my pack looked liked:

## The Route
{%include image.html url="/assets/images/2024/langleyhike-2024.jpg" desc="Langley Route" %}

Based on quick melt and route beta from other climbers we choose new Army pass, to go up Mt. Langley. As you will see in the figure about the traditional route from Old Army pass is also possible but its very steep and has not been maintained. We camped at Camp Long. Our Day 1 was about 8 miles with elevation gain of about 1000ft, and Day 2 we hike 17 miles & elevation gain of about 4900ft

## The Journey
Most of us camped at the Trailhead on Friday and has a fun bhel puri the evening before. Everyone seemed in great shape so we retired about 9pm to get some rest.
