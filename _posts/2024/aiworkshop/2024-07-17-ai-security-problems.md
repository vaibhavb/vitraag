# AI Security Problems
This post covers some interesting problem areas at the intersection of AI and Security. These could be worked on in an hackathon format.

- **AI-Powered Intrusion Detection System**
  Develop an AI-assisted intrusion detection system that can analyze network traffic patterns and system logs to identify potential security breaches in real-time.

- **Smart IoT Security Camera for Server Racks**
  Create an AI-powered IoT security camera system that monitors server racks, detects unauthorized access or equipment removal, and sends instant alerts to security personnel.

- **AI-Enhanced Red Team Automation**
  Design an AI system that can automate various aspects of red team operations, including vulnerability scanning, exploitation, and reporting, to improve the efficiency of penetration testing.

- **Automated Security Code Review**
  Develop an AI tool that can automatically review code for security vulnerabilities, suggesting fixes and best practices to developers in real-time.

- **AI-Driven Project Planning and Threat Modeling**
  Create an AI assistant that can help project managers and security professionals in identifying potential threats, conducting risk assessments, and developing comprehensive security plans for software projects.

- **AI-Enhanced pfSense Firewall**
  Integrate AI capabilities into the open-source pfSense firewall to improve threat detection, automate rule creation, and enhance overall network security.

- **AI-Powered Phishing Detection and Prevention**
  Develop an AI system that can analyze emails, links, and attachments to identify and prevent sophisticated phishing attempts in real-time.

- **Automated Incident Response Orchestration**
  Create an AI-driven incident response system that can automatically detect security incidents, prioritize them, and orchestrate appropriate response actions across multiple security tools.

- **AI-Based Malware Behavior Analysis**
  Design an AI system that can analyze the behavior of unknown files and processes to detect and classify new or evolving malware threats.

- **Secure AI Model Development and Deployment**
  Develop a framework and set of tools to ensure the secure development, testing, and deployment of AI models, protecting against adversarial attacks and data poisoning.

## What's next?
To assist with the Merritt Secure AI Hackathon we will be doing a pre-hackathon introduction to AI and Security webinar on Friday July 19th from 3-4pm. This webinar will also be recored.
