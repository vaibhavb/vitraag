Wow! I'm enjoying the univerisity town of oxford. With huge gothic (?) sculptures around and the plagues like the one in pic, i'm all of sudden feeling like i'm part of intelligentsia..hehe.. ! I'm getting ready to do a night biking tour of oxford may be check out the Alice's shop and then head to the pubs, with Srikumar!!
