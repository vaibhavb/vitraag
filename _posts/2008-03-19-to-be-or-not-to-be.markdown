Interesting points - why [this ](http://blog.blist.com/index.php/2008/03/18/working-for-a-startup-inside-bigco/)guy left Microsoft to join Redfin, why [this ](http://blog.redfin.com/blog/2007/08/will_work_for_food_why_i_left_microsoft_for_a_startup_.html)guy left to join Ontela and why [this ](http://blip.tv/file/160587)guy loves startups and what reason [this ](http://marcelo.sampasite.com/brave-tech-world/Ready-to-join-a-startup-10-thing.htm)guy has for you to leave the Empire and try something different.  
  
I would summarize a little and add that its not just about finding a new culture and also a new way of life! In the above links i liked the idea of creating a forcing function to move on!  
  
Whats your take on the big empire?
