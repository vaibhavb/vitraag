MSDN recently lauched a cool [new feature](http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/#sort=week&page=0&filter=allcontent) to let folks bookmark on MSDN and make it possible for the community to validate. I was looking for such a thing and was almost inclined to use [digg ](http://digg.com/)but now I have a neat option. Check out some [HealthVault bookmarks](http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/#sort=week&page=0&filter=allcontent&tags=healthvault), and yep contribute to the tag - HealthVault.
