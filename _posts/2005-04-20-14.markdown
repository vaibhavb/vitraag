[VaiBHAv's Homepage](http://www.cse.ucsc.edu/~vaibhav/) The UCSC all in one web-page, which i so dearly and nearly need to update. Its time to thing of a webstrategy, there is a craze nowaday of blogging. Atanu Dey, keep one for his [ramblings](http://www.deeshaa.org), and seems folks have started aggregating [desi bloggers!](http://www.tiffinbox.org/2005/03/desi_bloggers_m_2.html)

Blogging is a great concept as it serves the purpose of keeping a daily dairy and a list of web-marks. But i dont know sometimes I would like to write things which are just for me not public and i love to use a book and a pen...it promotes thinking. I havent been convinced of the digital thinking capability, thats one of the reason why i ramble here :).

Btw, some one said a nice thing yesterday

_People keep talking of Digital Divide but what about TV Divide, Radio Divide why wasn't there one!_
