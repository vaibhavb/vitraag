My sister - Vaidehi is one of the best cooks. Here she is in live action showing the intricacies of making [sambar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambar_%28dish%29) from left over [dal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dal) and frozen mixed vegetables. This is really quick to make and tastes wonderful!!
