[![St. Helens]({{site.images}}/2011/04/St.-Helens_thumb.jpg)]({{site.images}}/2011/04/St.-Helens.jpg)

 

Another installment of a pic and a poem inspired by White Horse, Taylor Swift:

 

<blockquote>  
> 
>         
“Rewards and returns don’t tally up
> 
> </blockquote>

 

Forces might dig a huge crater after a big blow

 

Life is not a fairy tale and days do drag on

 

The breadth encompassing all shades

 

And boarding down a wonder is priceless”
