I will be partially attending [OSCON 2008 ](http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2008/public/content/home)in Portland, next week. If you are around and want to say hi feel free to [holler ](http://twitter.com/vaibhavb)or [message](mailto://vaibhavb@gmail.com) or leave a comment here. This is my first time to OSCON and I have heard great things about it and i'm looking forward to the [state of onion](http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2008/public/schedule/detail/4871). [Microsoft ](http://www.microsoft.com/opensource/)is one of the Diamond sponsors -Â  [Sam Ramji ](http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2008/public/schedule/speaker/27454) is talking about Open Source Heros and[ John Lam](http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2008/public/schedule/speaker/2810) is delving in to IronRuby. This will be an oppurtunity for us at HealthVault to evaluate and see how we can move the state of art of our [Java](http://www.codeplex.com/HealthVaultJavaLib), [Ruby ](http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubyhealthvault/)and [PHP ](https://sourceforge.net/projects/healthvaultphp/)libraries by interacting with the opensource community and discover possible way to enhance our [open-ness](http://blogs.msdn.com/familyhealthguy/archive/2008/04/14/opening-up-the-vault.aspx).
