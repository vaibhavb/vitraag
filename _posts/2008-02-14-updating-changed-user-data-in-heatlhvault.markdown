     PersonalImage pItem = new PersonalImage(); pItem.LastUpdated;

In the HealthAndFitness application provided in HealthVault SDK, we provide a single click mechanism where the user can referesh all site data, perhaps something like this could be used to refresh the image or other individual data-items as well.
