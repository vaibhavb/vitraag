My last post explained a little about challenges of OpenSSL to achieve the healthvault signing for opensource LAMP/R platforms. In this post i'm showing below an actual snippet for talking to the public methods of healthvault platform.

Sean is starting a [series](http://www.familyhealthguy.com/2008/03/my-new-playground.html) detailing his adventure with healthvault .NET applcations. In the same spirit i'm going to build the ruby on rails application and library through a series of posts here. The application is live at [http://openhealthvault.vitraag.com](http://openhealthvault.vitraag.com/) and the source code is in the SVN repository at [http://svn.vitraag.com/openhealthvault](http://svn.vitraag.com/openhealthvault).
