**Mining Photo Archives****
**John Resig, used TinyEye’s MatchEngine to do computer vision on a photo archive. He has detailed his current work here - [http://ejohn.org/research/computer-vision-photo-archives/](http://ejohn.org/research/computer-vision-photo-archives/). The challenge in this project will be use John’s data and create various vision prototypes which can be compared with MatchEngine.
**Data Set(s):** Photo Archive [Link](http://ejohn.org/research/computer-vision-photo-archives/).

**Mitosis Detection in Breast Cancer Histological Images
**This [contest](http://ludo17.free.fr/mitos_2012/index.html) at ICPR 2012 outlines a good set of data with histological images for breast cancer. The challenge is to use computer vision to detect mitosis.
**Data Set(s)**: Histological images [link](http://ludo17.free.fr/mitos_2012/dataset.html).

**ImageNet Challenges
**ImageNet is really large set of images with about 1000 categories - [http://image-net.org/](http://image-net.org/). A number of computer vision [challenges](http://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2016/index#comp) are possible on this general purpose dataset.
**Data Set(s)**: Image Net [link](http://image-net.org/).
**Related Data Set**:  [CIFAR](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) is like ImageNet, but it is much smaller. There's the 10-category and the 100-category.

**Cancer Detection with Computer Vision
**There are tons of medical images in this collection of datasets, the Cancer Imaging Archive: [http://www.cancerimagingarchive.net](http://www.cancerimagingarchive.net) , a number of [challenge](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/Challenge+competitions) problems are possible on this archive.
**Data Set(s)**: Cancer Image Archive [link](http://www.cancerimagingarchive.net)
