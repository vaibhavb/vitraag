Earlier this year Myself and my colleague, [Chris Tremonte](http://christremonte.blogspot.com/), did a bike ride from Seattle to San Francisco. Thought I would link [my ride report](http://ramblings.vitraag.com/2009/10/cycling-to-sf-%e2%80%93-ride-report/) from here as well. Hopefully we helped in someway to increase the awareness for [HealthDataRights](http://www.healthdatarights.org).
