Inspired by success of the likes of [Y-combinator](http://ycombinator.com/index.html), a number of incubators have sprung up in last few years. Its encouraging to see that some have chosen to focus on Healthcare. With a trillion dollar market and a dire need for innovation seems like a right way to go. There has been a lot of [optimism](http://jaeselle.com/2011/01/2011-health-it-vc-investement-predictions/) on an increased VC presence in healthcare IT.!

Few notable incubators -<!-- more -->

  1. [Healthbox](http://www.healthboxaccelerator.com/) – Chicago based incubator, powered by Sandbox [industries](http://www.healthboxaccelerator.com/blog/).
  2. [Blueprint](http://www.blueprinthealth.org/index.php) – NYC based incubator started by Brad Weinberg founder of [Shapeup](http://www.shapeup.com/). Blueprint is focused more on enterprise startups
  3. [Rock health](http://rockhealth.com/) – A San Francisco based incubator. Most of the startups in the program are consumer focused.

**Why are healthcare startups hard?**  
I’ll highlight few of very well known facts about the health industry that serve as a big barriers for the startups --

  1. Regulations – There are a plethora of law’s regulating the industry – HIPAA, FDA etc.; and that in turn puts a lot of tax on a healthcare startup.
  2. Long sale cycles – Enterprise sales in the industry have very long sales cycles.
  3. Complicated economy – Someone has to give-up a dollar for startup to make one, its very hard to “generate” wealth in the Healthcare economy; it’s a very much a zero-sum economy. Additionally, the payer equation many times doesn’t align up well with other players in the system.

**So what are the characteristics of the winners?**  
Lets take example of very of the well-established healthcare startups and see if there are themes for success.

  1. Disruptors – [Patients like me](http://www.patientslikeme.com/) fundamentally challenges the current curing methodologies and introduces the social aspect to finding effective treatments using the power of social interaction.
  2. Enablers – [Zocdoc](http://www.zocdoc.com/) enables convenience for scheduling appointments and finding physicians. The service has seen a great uptake owing to fact that most folks like the ease of online scheduling.
  3. Cost Savers – Given that the health care economy is zero-sum a lot of companies fit this bill. Most enterprise companies playing in the re-admission management, pre-registration, public health reporting, meaningful use etc. play in this realm.
