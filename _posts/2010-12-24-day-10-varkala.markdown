The rest day at Varkala was amazing! I woke up late caught and then ate a lazy breakfast lunch and then went for a Keralan Ayurvedic Massage!

Ayurvedic Massage:
I'll write more about the naunces but my massage was essentially being marinated in oil! It was alrite.

The rest day just flew and we were ready to hit Kollam for going to Amma's Ashram in Amritapuri.
