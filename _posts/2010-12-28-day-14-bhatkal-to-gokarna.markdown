Today I arrived in bhatkal at about 11:30am and started to ride to Gokarna. Soon I was great by Western Ghats and the terrain was a a bit hilly than we had encountered so far. But Karnataka seemed more like north India with less but aggressive traffic.

With the heat and windy roady I landed in Gokarna at about 5pm! I did love the ride just hoped the sun was a bit mellow :).

In Gokarna check out the Mahabali and Parvati temple and witnessed another awesome sunset! With a bit of backpacker touch to this holy town I'm loving an interesting western and eastern tourist mix!

Tomorrow its about 100km to Canacona or Mashen, Hopefully I'll start birght and early and not bake in sun!
