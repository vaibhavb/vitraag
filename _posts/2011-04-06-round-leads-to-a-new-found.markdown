<pre>
“Round leads to a new found
Be it America’s discovery by Columbus
Or a wheel of a tour bus
Curves of Matri mandir Subside the exhibition
A few minutes inside and around
Might lead to a deep meditation and a new inspiration
Round leads to a new found..”

With this installment of pic and a poem, I’m adding a song – [Kryptonite, 3 doors down](http://youtu.be/xPU8OAjjS4k)..
