[![](https://vitraagblog.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/fd897-20090607-raceforcure-5k-map.jpg?w=300)](https://vitraagblog.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/fd897-20090607-raceforcure-5k-map.jpg)This morning I ran my first 5K - [the Susan G. Komen Race for cure](http://ww5.komen.org/). It was a great experience, I was astonished my the number of people who showed up to show their support for the breast cancer cause. Microsoft has a booth showcasing [HealthVault](http://www.healthvault.com/), and thanks to Anna, myself and Maris could participate in race as part of HealthVault team.

I started a little too fast as the table below will show, my first mile was a little too fast (started 7:00, averaged 7:53), which affected the third mile (avg 8:50min). Overall all I finished my first 5K in 26:04 mins, I was hoping to be in ball park of 22 mins but oh well, lesson learnt to pace myself and it was all for a good cause :). Here are the stats for the graphical and analytical folks:

She could easily have finished the race in 22-23 mins, if i didn't hold her back ;).

Anyways, it was a morning well spent with lots of friends (yay! Maggie...) and colleagues (yay! HealthVault..) participating in the race. Oh and the yogurt at finish line was delicious...
