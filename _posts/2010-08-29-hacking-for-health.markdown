The [Health 2.0 conference](http://www.health2con.com/) is the annual conference which show cases "new" internet technologies (aka Web 2.0) in Healthcare. This year with sponsorship and support from HHS (Health and Human Services) department, the conference is running [Health 2.0 Developer Challenge](http://health2challenge.org/). 

Health2.0 Developer Challenge hopes to spur developer creativity around newly about [data ](http://www.hhs.gov/open/plan/opengovernmentplan/initiatives/initiative.html)on Healthcare. To  help developers prepare and collaborate for this challenge Health2.0 and other along with Healthtap are running a developer Hackathon  -- [Hacking for Health](http://www.healthtap.com/tag/hackathon/) on Sep 11 in Palo Alto, CA. I'm planning to speak and present about some of our work on these datasets and help developers get started with HealthVault and other Microsoft offerings.

So mark the date, and if you are planning to be there drop be a note. I'm really excited to enable collaborative and creativity on these valuable datasets. If you are interested in knowing more about the datasets and collaborators, check out the Hacking for Health [data, tools and references](http://h4h.healthtap.com/).
