[![Heidi-BurningMan-2010]({{site.images}}/2011/03/Heidi-BurningMan-2010_thumb1.jpg)]({{site.images}}/2011/03/Heidi-BurningMan-20101.jpg)

I’m thinking of starting a series of post where every morning or every other morning I randomly pick out an old picture   from my collection and spend a few minutes writing my thoughts around when I took the picture, the place, the time      and  some more random context. Eventually I’m hoping to post a quite a few pictures of my childhood, my hometown and growing up. I always feel very lucky to have lived through immensely rich and varied life experiences from growing up in a small town to climbing mountains or cycling coasts!

So here is to the first installment a picture from Burning Man 2010 :


<blockquote>“There are times in life
When the climes are ripe
However blue you might feel
Under the desert sky just past night
The color pink might be just right!”</blockquote>




<blockquote>Thoughts, ideas, comments please share on….!</blockquote>
