Well I have been creating fun electronic projects for few years now. The hobby started during my bachelor’s program back in Mumbai, I create several electronic projects and won the electronics competitions, even though I was computer science major. Now that I finally have a space to work in, I’m thinking of devoting a small nook to be able to do electronic fun projects.


### Projects


So what project would be I wanting to complete with my new electronics lab? Following is a short list -<!-- more -->

> The top project I want to complete is a bar stool which has an artistic led setup with alcohol bottles. I would like to incorporate a muscial instrument in this stool something along the lines of laser harp mention [here](http://www.hackthings.com/rock-out-with-arduino-music-related-hacks/), more on it soon. I want to try and use the [Adruino’s](http://www.arduino.cc) for this project, but I have also been intrigued by [electric imp](http://www.electricimp.com/)! It might a be cool project to use the Arduino, Electric Imp and the [COSM](https://cosm.com/) or [Carriots](https://www.carriots.com/) service to internet enable and control your [project](https://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/397).
