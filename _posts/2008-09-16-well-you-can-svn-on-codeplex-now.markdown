So [CodePlex ](http://www.codeplex.com/) launched support for TortoiseSVN, more details about it are [here](http://blogs.msdn.com/codeplex/archive/2008/09/14/codeplex-launches-support-for-tortoisesvn.aspx). In the past there have been a couple of HealthVault projects which chose to do something else since SVN was not available on CodePlex, so this is a really great news. The SVN support is through SVN Bridge - essentially CodePlex is now hosting a bridge server which will let you talk to the native TFS project using a SVN client. Well - may be you can check out the [HealthVaultD2C ](http://www.codeplex.com/HealthVaultD2C)sample using TortoiseSVN now :).
