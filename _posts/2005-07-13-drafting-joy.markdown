One of the arts i learnt on STP is drafting. Its almost true that laziness is mother of invention. Drafting is biking close to the biker in front of you at speeds above 15mph so that you get the advantage of not having to deal with wind resistance, it saves almost 30-40 percent energy in bad winds. This is what the brids who fly in flocks achieve.

Almost half of the STP I was drafting ;). Lazy guy!- but hej wait i did pull the draft for quite a sometime too once for about 5-6 miles with a duplex and other time with a batch of MSN search chick team.

In this pic i'm drafting in a very cool bunch. While passing a biker the puller would always say - "on your left and five ugly guys behind" :).
