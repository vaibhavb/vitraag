On November 15th, the doors of 10 US [Techshops](http://www.techshop.ws) abruptly shut down, leaving hundreds of entrepreneurs, small business and thousands of maker members stranded — just before the holidays.




This is the first time I have witnessed a business being closed down such ruthlessly and a limited thought given to the aftermath. When Google Health closed down, I witnessed a pretty good pass-off to other vendors. I wonder if Techshop could have been more graceful about their demise.

A number of group [Techshop Orphans](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2027755187468776/) on Facebook, [Hackers & Makers](https://join.slack.com/t/sfbayareamakers/shared_invite/enQtMjczMjA1ODA0NDA1LTllZTQ5NTViYjQ1ZjU2NDFiMTczNTdhY2Q4ZTVkNWM0OTlkMDcxM2M2MjFhMmYxNzhlNjg3ZmIwOWQyZGNhZTY) on Slack and numerous [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=techshop&src=typd) and Facebook threads have pop’ed up. The maker movement has suffered a blow but more so it’s clear that some of this might be pure mis-management than an obvious business model issue.




At least in SF Bay Area numerous institutions like [Hacker Dojo](https://www.hackerdojo.com/Makerspace) in San Jose, [Noise Bridge](http://www.noisebridge.net) in SF, [Ace Monster Toys](https://www.acemonstertoys.org/) in Berkeley and machine makers like Glowforge, Inventables, littlebits and formlabs are offering [discounts](http://blog.inventables.com/2017/11/techshop-bankruptcy-open-letter-to.html). The community has put together a [resource list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iVCKAojmuTeLjwvuDNswxecZMtwRYursKwR7ax2AhuA) for those looking for immediate tool library or assistance.

I’m interested in being part of the group which re-boots techshop in a new way. Some like minded folks have started a [questionnaire](https://goo.gl/forms/MMPLUZK6GBMwepK83) on it as well. Feel free to leave a comment and share your thoughts as well.
