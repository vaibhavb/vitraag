I'll keep today's post really short but want to let you guys know it was epic! We did almost 130km starting to go on highway NH47 but later decided to take the coast. The traffic on highway was horrible and the coast had bad roads, but it was amazing biking day. We ended up biking an hour in dark and reached Kovalam at 8pm, got an amazing Keralan dinner at the beach and for a change there are no loudspeakers or horns around our dwelling!!

In Kerala the first thing i noticed is Mamooty replacing Rajnikant on the hoarding and CPM replacing BJP in the rally fliers competition!!

More to come as I get time!! Looking forward to pleasant, commotion less beach now that my pilgrimage is over!
