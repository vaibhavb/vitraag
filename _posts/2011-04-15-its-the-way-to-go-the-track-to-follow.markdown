Another installment of a pic and a poem, this time inspired by [Even better than the real thing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yrch66gdjjk) by U2 --

<pre>
“Don't quit trying,
Else you will face tyranny
Face straight and chin up
Is the way to go
Whether there is way or a wall
Its the way to go, the track to follow
And get even better than the real thing
Its the way to go, the track to follow”
</pre>
