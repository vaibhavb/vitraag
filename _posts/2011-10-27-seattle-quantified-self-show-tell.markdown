Yesterday was the [third](http://www.meetup.com/Quantified-Self-Seattle/events/36589652/) Seattle Quantified Self Show & Tell.

For those new to the idea, [Quantified Self](http://quantifiedself.com/) is a forum for users and tool makers to interact and share knowledge, experiences, tips & tricks to enable better self discovery through tracking. The Seattle chapter of this forum is managed by great folks at [Habitlabs](http://habitlabs.com/) (Buster & Amelia) and [Limeade](http://limeade.com/) (David).

<!-- more -->With over 20 people joining the conversation it was great to see energy in self-tracking and self-improvement. Most people seem to share the problem of not knowing what to do with the data they have. It was interesting to see Amelia to talk about [positive effect](http://www.ginkgoprintshop.com/2011/02/life-design-experiments.html) of just tacking a 10-day running average of her weight. Robby gave a great presentation on his [month long project](http://vis.robbymacdonell.com/transportation-infographic/) to track transportation costs, and the conclusion to use a bicycle.

Iâ€™m looking forward to hear more this community. I have been trying to use [HealthVault PowerShell](http://healthblog.vitraag.com/2011/10/healthvault-powershell-module-the-beginnings/) and excel with [power-pivot](http://www.microsoft.com/bi/en-us/solutions/pages/powerpivot.aspx) to track and visualize few properties of Health data.
