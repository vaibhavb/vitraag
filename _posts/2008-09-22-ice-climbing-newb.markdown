[![Ice climbing is a type of climbing.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/Eisklettern_kl_engstligenfall.jpg/202px-Eisklettern_kl_engstligenfall.jpg)](http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Eisklettern_kl_engstligenfall.jpg)Image via [Wikipedia](http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Eisklettern_kl_engstligenfall.jpg)On Saturday I had a great time chomping on the Serac's in the lower [Coleman glacier](http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=48.7809533,-121.8476463&spn=1.0,1.0&q=48.7809533,-121.8476463&t=h) on Mt.Baker! Rob was helping me learn the basics of [Ice Climbing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_climbing). Well both of us forgot our camera's so no pictures. But truly the weather was way better than we expected and we had good view of Mt. Baker and the high meadows were really pretty.  
  
So what all did I learn? The one main thing to learn about crampons is what ever you do try to get the most points in. What this implies is if you are coming downhill then do freaking edge (you will trip!), but try to roll your ankle towards the downhill side and get more points in, and better is dont edge at all!  
  
One trick of the trade of secret I learn from Rob is how to position and balance myself. The idea is to swing the tool, hand from it with your wrist and then then move your legs up such that one leg is on either side of the tool. Once you are in balance and have three point of contact just stand up and swing the other tool. This way one doesn't barn door and uses much of legs.  
  
I over used by hands, had a very tight grip and was very sloppy with my footwork. Well the result is i gotjavascript:void(0) a little sore and ran out of gas much earlier than i expected.   
  
I have a lot to learn, but meanwhile just for shits and giggle check out this nice beginner video on ice climbing. And yep! thanks to Rob for hauling me in and introducing to Ice Climbing!:
