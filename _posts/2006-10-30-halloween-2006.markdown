This halloween I dressed up like a 80s disco dancer, very characterisitic of bollywood actor Mithun Chakravarty. Initially the plan was to be a cook cooking war or a broken voting machine, but hey both of them were way more work than this. And yep! finally i got to wear my red polka dotted shirt!! Wohoo!!!
