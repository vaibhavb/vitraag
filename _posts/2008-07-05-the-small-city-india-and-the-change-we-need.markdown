[SiliconIndia](http://www.siliconindia.com/), apparently one of the primere India professional network reports that India has [degraded ](http://www.siliconindia.com/shownews/43223)in its Forbes business potential ranking. The prime reasons it gives is high inflation and increased personal freedom.  
  
For a while we have been the media has been focusing on every form of outsourcing, technology and the big business cities. But the "gross" in the India GDP comes from small city and small town India. The inflation is attribute of the increased disproportional spending of this small city India. Bit city India was always able to do this! What pains me is that the core problems of the economy are not made a day to day problem talk:  
- How is the O of outsourced economy going to finally reach small city India?  
- How is the T of technology affect the education in small cities  
- How is that bright young folks can find employment in small town India to make a not only local but a global change. Can an infrastrucure to support this be built?  
  
I gradually moved from a small town to smaller town to wealthy city to wealthier country. There is immense opportunity on all this levels but we publicize and want to go after only the top notch ones. It will be great exercise to actually start building the belief in local oppurtunity, and i love that my friend Nipun is doing something like [that](http://www.karmatube.org/). Check out [Karma Tube](http://www.karmatube.org/) is a set of inspirational pieces motivating the change which can happen locally.
