[![tosi-dinner-poem]({{site.images}}/2011/04/tosi-dinner-poem_thumb.jpg)]({{site.images}}/2011/04/tosi-dinner-poem.jpg)

Another installment of pic and poem, inspired by [I Gotta Feeling](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSD4vsh1zDA), by Black Eyed Peas -

<pre> 
â€œThere is rice, and rasam
There is poddi and pickle
Food on a banana leaf is a tradition from the south
Makes for a growing appetite and a water mouth
A morsel of delicious food in company of compassionate kindling
Makes for a good good night, I gotta a feeling!
</pre>
