[![TOSI-Dinner-Poem]({{site.images}}/2011/04/TOSI-Dinner-Poem_thumb.jpg)]({{site.images}}/2011/04/TOSI-Dinner-Poem.jpg)

 

Another installment of pic and poem, inspired by [I Gotta Feeling](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSD4vsh1zDA), by Black Eyed Peas -

 

â€œThere is rice, and rasam

 

There is poddi and pickle

 

Food on a banana leaf is a tradition from the south

 

Makes for a growing appetite and a water mouth

 

A morsel of delicious food in company of compassionate kindling

 

Makes for a good good night, I gotta a feeling!
