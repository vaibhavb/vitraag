This December 2010 (Dec 14, 2010 – Jan 5, 2011) I’m planning to bike along the Indian peninsula, perhaps from Chennai to Goa. I’m starting this articles to keep track of all the planning required for this trip. The goal is to cover about 60 miles a day and also take a couple of days off for sight-seeing.

**Fig 1. 1300 miles from Chennai to Goa**

**Update (Sep 24): So the itinerary is like 2100km in 21 days, which might not leave time for sight seeing. So the current thinking is to reduce the Chennai to Madurai leg. The must dos are --**




    
  * Temples in south India (Madurai)

    
  * Night on a house boat in Kerala

    
  * Two days in Goa

  * A very good [ride report](http://www.mrpumpy.net/rides/9-india-south/BSA-India-1.html) from Mr.Pumpy.
