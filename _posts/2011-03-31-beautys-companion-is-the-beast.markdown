[![Mt.Baker]({{site.images}}/2011/03/Mt.Baker_thumb.jpg)]({{site.images}}/2011/03/Mt.Baker_.jpg)Another installment of a pic and a poem -

 

“Beauty’s companion is the beast

 

There is hunger preceding a real feast

 

White complements black and so does yin with yang

 

Life’s battles are small and big

 

But with every victory there is a smile to be had

 

<blockquote>  
> 
> And with every summit there is a grandeur to be imbibed!”
