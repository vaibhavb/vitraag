Very interestingly the [Microsoft Common User Interface](http://www.mscui.net/) provides a set of ASP/WinForms controls which applications and user iterface designers can use to provide safe clinical applications! Its available as [CodePlex Project](http://www.codeplex.com/mscui)!!! From my brief research i havent seen such a approach before other than the IBM [CUA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_User_Access) which was more about uniformity of user controls. I'm not sure that with the adoption of MVC model of web/app development the ASP/WinForms style controls will be more in demand in the future. Anyways one thing which sucks about it is that you can see what the controls are until you download the 13Megs of software, it would have been great to see some snapshots somewhere!!!
