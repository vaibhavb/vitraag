Starting to Ideate a Cyber Defenders Hackathon

With Malwarebytes, San Jose Evergreen Community College, and several other educational & Cyber Security partners we are excited to start thinking about a cyber security hackathon targeting Feb 2018.




Following are main objectives for this hackathon targeted to students seeking internship and careers in Cyber Security with at least two years of computer science backgroud:






  * 
**Skill Development : **Learn concrete Cyber Security skills like application of machine learning for malware analysis with workshops as part of the two days of hackathon


  * 
**Industry Experience: **Complete a cyber security project with guidance and mentorship from participating industry experts. The projects will be judged by experts in cyber security


  * 
**Employment Opportunity**: Earn Internship opportunities by interacting with participating employers




Some other ideas we thought of for this hackathon are along the lines of capture the flag fun evening contests or a ethical hacking contest.The next item on list is to make a list of fun Cyber Security Challenges which will be great projects which fit in the hackathon format.




With this hackathon we are targeting students in Northern California (collegiate and community colleges). Would love your feedback on potential date of Feb 9 (Fri) — Feb 10 (Sat) at MalwareBytes Offices in San Jose, CA.




**Update (Jan 12, 2018)**: We are shooting for March 2–3. Here is a *tentative draft* flyer for the event:
