Starting a blog for Monad ramblings!! Here is the first port about the Monad Package Manager i have written, its very very alpha and needs a new scriptdepot. But hej Microsoft is going to move fast to win the web but until then i'll use what serves my purpose. So here it is Introoducing **MPKG - the Monad Package manager**

Introducting the Monad package manager. You can download it from [http://www.cse.ucsc.edu/~vaibhav/scriptdepot/mpkg.msh](http://www.cse.ucsc.edu/~vaibhav/scriptdepot/mpkg.msh).

The [scriptdepot](http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/~vaibhav/scriptdepot/) contains a bunch of monad scripts to experiement with. To install the package manager copy the script to your msh directory and run it as follows: mpkg.msh -install [http://www.cse.ucsc.edu/~vaibhav/scriptdepot/mpkg.msh](http://www.cse.ucsc.edu/~vaibhav/scriptdepot/mpkg.msh)

You are all set to explore the package manager. It allows you to search the internet for scripts just type mpkg.msh -search [query].

Fun! fun !! ride enjoy!!
