[Monthly Average Graph (Indian Rupee, American Dollar) 2005](http://www.x-rates.com/d/INR/USD/hist2005.html)of Rupee vs. Dollar shows a constant decline of dollar. Dollar is hitting a huge valley. About a year before it was 46.5 Rs. and now its 43.37!! Man!! day by day seems the amount i'm earning is useless, and my efforts, dreams not as grandeur!!

The other thing which have always confused me is how the banks give exhange rates to customers. Is ICICI Money2India good enough for transacting money to my family in India or I losing like a rupee for each dollar. I dont understand. May be one of these days i'll read something or meet someone who really is street smart in this......but as of now my money is hitting the sink...zooop!!!
