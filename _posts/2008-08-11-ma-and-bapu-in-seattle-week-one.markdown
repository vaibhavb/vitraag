I have been looking forward to my parents' visit. They arrived to Seattle last Sunday and below is a video diary and [here ](http://flickr.com/photos/vaibhavb/tags/parentsvisit08weekone/)are pictures of what we have been up to last week. We had a fun time camping in [Fort Casey State Park](http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=48.1643888889,-122.677611111&spn=1.0,1.0&q=48.1643888889,-122.677611111&t=h) on [Whidbey Island](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whidbey_Island) - this was first time camping experience for my parents :)!  
  
      
  
I took extra care to make the experience a little pleasant! The forecast was rain so we headed for a little less damp and open area. I also switched to an air mattress instead of sleeping bags - and yep brought in all the big pleasures of car camping like chairs, grill, firewood and yep - watermelon!! Oh my parents love the sweet corn!  
  
On a side-note I have been trying to motivate and encourage my folks to pay more attention to their health. The great success is now they track their weight and blood-pressure every day!! A sweet result of this is that now we can correlate the days they have high [blood pressure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure) to the days when they are sitting at home!! So yep  going on walk is an incentive to see those numbers do better. I think the next step for me is to get a pedometer for Dad so that he can keep track of how many steps he walks every day!!  
  
However the big deal in whole deal of parents' health is [healthy eating](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthy_diet)!! With typical east indian cuisine a lot of oil, and unhealthy fat makes way in to ones diet. My elder sister who is a Dermatologist gave a tip to try and control the salt intake first, and stress a little more on fruits. I need to make sure that Mom now starts cooking healthy stuff and yep! not give in to pressure/ craving from me or Dad :)!!!
