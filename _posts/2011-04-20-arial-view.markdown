Another installment of pic and a poem, inspired by Grapefruit Diet by “Weird Al” Yankovic - 

<pre>
“F = M X A, Force is mass in to action
Planets revolve around the sun, and Kepler’s laws govern the motion of moons as well
206 bones and 850 odd muscles, make up the Human anatomy
Shades, tinges, palettes and complimentary colors contemplate a theory
There are conflicts, conundrums and disputes in all of above in a close up view
But take a 10,000 foot shot, theories, hypothesis and beliefs gel well in an Arial view
In an Arial view, harmony and beauty abides, in an Arial view”
</pre>
