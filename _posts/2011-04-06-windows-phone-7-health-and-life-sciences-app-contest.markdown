Get your creative geek on and be part of the [Health and Life Sciences application contest](http://www.microsoft.com/health/en-us/campaigns/pages/windows-phone-7-contest.aspx). The ten winning entries get an XBOX 360 console with Kinect for each team participant and a chance to make difference in Healthcare!

In addition to the application ideas on the contest website feel free to use the [resources](http://vitraag.com/health20boston/) from Health hack-a-thons. Perhaps it will be great to see some mash-ups using data from [http://www.data.gov/health.](http://www.data.gov/health.)

 

Drop me a note if you need help connecting your mobile applications with HealthVault or are trying to explore the Health [datasets](http://www.data.gov/communities/node/81/data_tools).

 

Update: If you want to take your project to the next level, [RockHealth](http://rockhealth.com/) might have some seed funding for you!
