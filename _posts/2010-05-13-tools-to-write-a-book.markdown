After a lot of research on best tools to write a book, I’m choosing Ascii doc. Why Ascii doc?




    
  * Its really easy to translate Ascii doc to doc-book format

    
  * It has number of plug-ins for cool [output formatters](http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/index.html#X5)

    
  * It has been used by a number of successful [books](http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_frm/thread/449f1199343f0e27).

    
  * It has a very good [cheat sheet](http://powerman.name/doc/asciidoc).



Alrite, I’m convinced – so how does the initial conversion of my upcoming book look? Following is an example version of the [same](http://silosbook.vitraag.com).

Next things to do:




    
  * Move the real content to this format

    
  * Add links for feedback
