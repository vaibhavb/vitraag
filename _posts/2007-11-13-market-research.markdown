I was wondering if there is more insight and suggestions wrt tools for Market Research.  
  
I recall from the class the various tools one can use  


  * - Industry associations
  * - Competitor websites
  * - Public financial reports of competitors.

Particularly i wanted the ball mark data on quantities, customer segments and overhead cost which wine distributors reckon with.  I couldn't get enough information from the industry associations or competitor's website and was wondering what else could i try. I need data to estimate the bulk and $$ required to sell wine to adistributor (typically the wine industries middle men).
