# What is Lapsi?
Lapsi is an easy to make, quick, simple, and earthy dessert. You don’t need any fancy ingredients or utensils for making this humble dessert.

In this dessert broken wheat aka Dalia is roasted with ghee until golden in color. Roasting the cracked wheat in ghee gives this Lapsi a rich and classic brown color, intense aroma, and a delicate flavor.

After roasting it is cooked/boiled in water until soft. Later this is sweetened with some sugar/jaggery. And finally, it is flavored with some coconut shavings and cardamom.

This is one of such timeless recipes which is adored by people of all age groups. My family loves it!

# Ingredients
- 1/2 cup broken wheat (dalia)
- 2.5 cups hot boiling water
- 1/4 cup sugar/jaggery, or more to taste (I don’t like lapsi too sweet, that’s why I am adding 1/4 cup sugar)

- 1/2 tablespoon chopped pistachio
- 1/2 tsp cardamom powder
- 2 tablespoons coconut shavings
