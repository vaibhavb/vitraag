<h2 id="hot-takes">Hot Takes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The rising costs of cancer care are a significant concern globally. Factors contributing to this increase include the high price of new cancer drugs and therapies, the growing prevalence of cancer as populations age, and the need for long-term and sometimes lifelong treatment.</li>
  <li>The global digital health market is projected to grow significantly in the coming years. In 2024, it is estimated to be valued at approximately USD 296.46 billion. This market is expected to continue its growth trajectory, reaching around USD 655.57 billion by 2029, expanding at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.20% during this period. This growth is driven by factors like increased adoption of digital healthcare solutions, advancements in artificial intelligence, IoT, and big data, as well as the rising use of mobile health applications and government initiatives supporting digital health. However, concerns regarding the security of patient data might pose challenges to this growth.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="engagements">Engagements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>No one talks about the care giving crisis, and how the health industry is going to solve it. Illnessed like cancer leave the patient confused and hopeless event especially because care management is not solved.
