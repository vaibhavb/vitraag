      an early-stage startup, prioritize selecting an identity provider and enforcing
      the use of hardware security keys for strong authentication. Embrace Infrastructure
      as Code (IaC) and managed infrastructure services to build a secure, auditable,
      and scalable foundation. Finally, implement a Mobile Device Management (MDM)
      solution early to secure endpoints and simplify future software deployment and
      device management.
